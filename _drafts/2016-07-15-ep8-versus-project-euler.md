## A common enough conversation: where do you wanna meet up?

Every other week or so I like to grab a pint with a particular friend of mine and catch up. Hopefully you too have a friend like this. Someone you can share stupid and serious ideas with. Someone who appreciates your sensibility and opinion. Most importantly, someone who can hold an interesting coversation, be occassionally irreverant, and have a laugh over a good beer. 

In New York there are a ton of options for grabbing a good pint, especially with the rotating taps at most self-respecting places. If you work in the city odds are you're either in Midtown or the Financial District. If you enjoy good beer and less of a bustling afterwork crowd chances are you won't stick around long in these neighborhoods, unless you're simply with your work collegues and kicking back a few, unwilling to be the douche that makes everyone else accomodate his beer snobbish palatte by going to some less than office-convenient bar. Don't be that guy. At least have some finesse and teach people slowly about what good beer is and entice them that way over time. Make it seem like it's their decision to go to "that bar with the weird but delicious beers".[1]

Depending on the choice of bar, and this is determined by a litany of considerations: convenience to work/home, newness of establishment, grub, and of course beer selection, there is then the logistical matter of getting your ass from the office chair to the bar stool. Subways usually (nearly always, really) play a role and then there is that other time tested New York means of travel, walking. Tourist or resident, you can't help notice the importance and etiquete of walking in the city[http://www.travelandleisure.com/slideshows/walking-in-new-york-city]. 

I like to play a game called "Shark Walk" where if you stop moving you "die". The goal is to get from A to B without waiting at a light. Besides jaywalking, also a NYC tradition, and running to beat traffic, preferably avoided,[2] your best bet is knowing your options, staying alert to traffic lights, and minding your pace. It's always preferable to "pick it up" a bit or lay back to standing at a corner waiting for the traffic to pass. And this is not jogging, so running in place does not count.[3]

This game is applicable to lunch hour walks, taking a stroll (can you say _flaneur_?[4]), or making your way from the subway stop to the delicious pint waiting for you on draft at your watering hole of choice. If you want to keep moving and give yourself the impression that you've got some little bit of control in this mad city[kendrick link] then know your options, which brings us back to the topic at hand. How many ways are there of getting from here, thirsty, to there, imbibing?

## A Simple Example (credit to the MTA)

Two blocks away: straight line
Two blocks away: L-shape

## More Options the Farther Away

Three blocks: straight line
Four blocks: straight line
Four blocks: 2x2
