## A common enough conversation: where do you wanna meet up?

Every other week or so I like to grab a pint with a particular friend of mine and catch up. Hopefully you too have a friend like this. Someone you can share stupid and serious ideas with. Someone who appreciates your sensibility and opinion. Most importantly, someone who can hold an interesting coversation, be occassionally irreverant, and appreciates good beer. In New York there are a ton of options for grabbing a good pint, especially with the rotating taps at most self-respecting places. If you work in the city odds are you're either in Midtown or the Financial District. If you enjoy good beer and less of a bustling afterwork crowd chances are you won't stick around long in these neighborhoods, unless you're simply with your work collegues and kicking back a few, unwilling to be the douche that makes everyone else accomodate his beer snobbish palatte by going to some less than office-convenient bar.
