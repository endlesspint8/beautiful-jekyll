## The Dutch Know Beer

The Netherlands has a long standing beer history [http://www.europeanbeerguide.net/hollbrw1.htm & http://www.europeanbeerguide.net/hollbrw2.htm] and the only non-Belgian Trappist brewery, La Trappe [http://www.latrappetrappist.com/en/], to prove it. Beer culture in Holland manifests itself in many ways. From the beheometh Heineken [http://www.heineken.com/], to the  aforementioned Trappist brewery, and the ever burgeoning microbrew scene [http://www.iamsterdam.com/en/visiting/what-to-do/eating-and-drinking/bars-and-cafes/beer-sampling-in-amsterdam/best-craft-and-speciality-beer-bars] in between, beer is to be found at most getogethers, festivals, and celebrations, as well as fine and low restaurants alike. Below I present some of my findings and explorations in this beer haven of a nation. I hope this sample entices you to grab a Dutch brew the next time you're offered the chance.

## Reuz Stout

It's the beginning of June and I'm drinking a <a href="http://www.reuzenbieren.com/" target="_blank">Reuz</a> Stout. A barrel appears on the label but this version of the beer is not aged. However it does come in at a respectable 9.5% ABV. Predictably black, this good looking stout give off hints of dark brown around the edges, and especially at the top of the glass. The smell is familiar to anyone who's had a respectable stout and explored beyond Guinness (footnote: no disrespect to Guinness. It’s just that there’s more to stout than Irish stouts, is all). It is definitely sweet but by no means cloying, has a nice mouthfeel, and a light roasted touch. Smooth is definitely a word that comes to mind. When I suggest that it has a caramel flavor I have the Belgian doubles in mind and if not caramel then perhaps toffee.

Do not think that because I gravitate to the label so quickly I do not enjoy the beer but rather that I respect and appreciate the amount of information provided, as well as the detail and the display of the data. For instance, everything is clearly defined, from alcohol percentage, to storage temperature, as well as the glass and temperature it should be served in. Below that we have a different set of categories that provide us with diet details, number of calories, and IBU’s. One of my favorite things about European beer bottles are the prohibition symbols indicating who should not be drinking. For instance there is the silhouette of a pregnant lady in profile, an image of a car, and the number 18 (footnote: the latter two are not present on the label image off of the brewery website but do appear on my version). Each of these are surrounded by a red circle with a slash across them, reminiscent of the Ghostbusters symbol, suggesting that we don't want these ghosts. 

It doesn't take long,  just a couple of sips and a little bit of reflection to realize that the well hidden alcohol behind the delicious flavors is having its effect and once again I gravitate to the label. Now I'm attracted by the image and no longer care about the numbers and descriptions of the beer itself. On the frontside of the label a giant reclines while drinking,  there is a dwarf sitting on one of his knees, himself sitting and drinking. The giant looks merry, the dwarf the same, and I am happy to be in their company. Time for another sip. 

A third of the way through the beer and with its continued warming the flavors begin to mature further. Additionally the mouth feel of the beer becomes more pronounced and leaves a fine, not unpleasant, coating. The beer is clean in its flavors, its aftertaste, and the lacing, or lack thereof, on the glass.

Again it is June here, the beginning of June. This means that it is not quite summer though the weather is showing signs of warming and has occasionally broken into the 80’s. So why am I drinking such a dark beer, a strong beer? For one, I enjoy the style. For another, this is not always the warmest place to be – I'm referring to the Netherlands of course.

# WEATHER INSERT

Punchline: for those of you who can't make Rio for the Olympic games, which by the way for them it's winter, come right over to Amsterdam where the weather is basically the same. Except more overcast, more rain, and less total sunlight.

The upside to Holland not getting too hot is that I can more easily disregard (traditional) seasonal drinking and suit myself to the beers I wish to have in the moment. 

I thought half of the six beers to profile would be dark and the other three of lighter styles. This would allow me to cover a wide range of styles in just one post. Whether that turns out to be the case may be determined by what state I’m in after drinking this 9.5% beer and my girlfriend finds me. It may very well turn out that I do a profile of one beer and five sparkling waters from the Netherlands. Damn giant and dwarf. 

> Dutch point: My first introduction to this beer was at a local cafe where this stout was nonchalantly listed on their menu. While in the Netherlands you may be presented with less draft choices than you’re used to at your regular US craft bar the NL bars make up for it with a wide bottle selection and an equally dazzling collection of matching glassware. 


## LOC & de 3 Horne’s Naughty Boy

> Dutch point: Bars will rotate their bottles as likely, sometimes more often, than their draft choices.

LOC: http://www.locbrewery.com/

de 3 Horne: https://de3horne.nl/

Is it a stout, is it a BIPA? Certainly a bit of both. The photo shows the foam suggesting a Belgian-y yeast. The color and roast flavors say "stout". The nose and forward flavor say "hops". The label itself says a whole lot and nothing at all. Beside the cartoon we are provided a runon sentence that was written under some type of influence and Google translate [twitter link to #GoogleTranslate] mashup.

<img src="/gallery/2016/sixpack/loc_naughty_boy2.jpg">


"_This brew was never meant to be, the recipe was never written and the ABV and IBU was never calculated. But this naughty boy wouldn't listen, so from the second runnings of the LOC brewery Imperial Stout '84' he became... If he is any good, well we dare not to say as this naughty boy is not to be trusted. Slightly toasted, malty flavor with a hint of savory together with the characteristics from the cascade and centennial hops._

_Well just drink with mate_!"

I’ve enjoyed this brew several times, both at home and at the bars, and I knew I’d include it among the selection. I was obviously disappointed to find out that it is not as well received by most reviewers. I believe this is a result of possibly misplaced expectations. When I first drank it I wasn’t aware of the style and considered it a BIPA. Only after more closely reviewing and attempting to decipher the label, as well as visiting the brewery and beer review sites, did I see it was meant as a stout. I am going to argue this should be amended.

## Emelisse Saison

<img src="/gallery/2016/sixpack/emelisse_saison2.jpg">

> Dutch point: Excellent bottle shops everywhere: across the border, next to supermarkets, in supermarkets. There’s a hazier line between craft and not here. Longer uninterrupted beer tradition. 

This is easily one of my favorite breweries from the Netherlands. For me it made sense to use them for a style that is not one of my go-to’s. Based on past (good) experiences with their beers I figured they would make this an offering I would like and I could try another style. 

There are many things I enjoy about this brewery: of course first and foremost is the quality of the beers they make, beyond that is also the presentation. I'm not quite sure where you stand on the spectrum of accepting or denying the influences of marketing and packaging but I will not pretend that I am not swayed by its influence. The type and colors of the labels, yes we're talking about labels again, are clean and easily recognizable on the shelf.

I decided to pour this beer into a small thin glass, perhaps thinking it would look better, and of course, it being a saison with the requisite yeast, I naturally got a lot of foam. I was on the lookout for this and avoided wasting a drop. I simply waited patiently until the foam subsided enough for me to pour more into the glass. I waited some more as it rose and then poured in still more. It's been raining pretty heavily here for the last two weeks but as you can tell from the photo today is a sunny day, what better time to open up this beer. 

# SUNLIGHT: NY & LA

This does not feel like a light beer. The label says 4.6% alcohol and it is certainly not something that's going to knock you on your ass, but there is a full mouth feel, a light toffee, certainly malty, backbone which would easily lead you to believe that this could stand its own against many dishes [the brewmasters table recommendation]. Again, it’s not necessarily my favorite style but I’ve had my fair share and can say this an enjoyable release. To recap: quick forming foam head, delicate nose, and light spices. Light orange body with many small bubbles on initial pour with a subsiding frenzy the longer it sits. 

## De Molen Rook & Vuur (Smoke & Fire)

> Dutch point: Urban renewal and repurpose. Eindhoven, Rotterdam

I am a big fan of stout beers (footnote:clearly, based on the choice of beers in this piece) and definitely a fan of smoke beers, put them together for a winning combination. If done right. This last crucial detail turned out to be a point of contention on BeerAdvocate. A handful of people were definitely not impressed with the resulting combination. Thankfully I did not fall into this camp. I would anticipate at least benefitting from a short supply chain and lower risks of bottle shock [movie link]. For me the combination was a success, so the camp I fell into should be pretty clear. I wanted to know if my description would bear this out so I took my review, in blue below, and ran it through some text analysis to see what BA reviews I matched up closest to.

This beer was bottled in January 2015 I am now enjoying it a year and half into its four year recommended window. The nose is what you would expect from a rauchbier. It pours enticingly dark with a thin head that does not build. There is still some carbonation within the bottle witnessed by bubbles casually drifting to the top. This beer is packing an expected punch in both alcohol and flavor. I definitely took the precaution of having a meal before, more for the flavor than the solid ABV (8.5%). It packs such a flavor punch that any food would have to accommodate itself to the beer, and not the other way around. Initially coming out of the bottle the smoke is most present in the nose and taste. However, as the beer warms and we continue to sip from it we begin to get the spicy tingle.

Sticking with the theme we have here another gorgeous label. So far we've had goofy, elegant,  kitsch [http://faculty.georgetown.edu/irvinem/theory/Sontag-NotesOnCamp-1964.html], and now something that I would characterize as “the essentials”. All the information and only the information is presented on the label. It looks not unlike what I imagine olde medicine (apothecary) did before radio, television, and that crazy thing young people call the world wide web. 

<img src="/gallery/2016/sixpack/Rook-Vuur-33cl.jpg">

Aside from the meal ahead of time I also made sure to make my lunch before I sat down to enjoy this brew. That's another thing about the Dutch nearly all of them bring food to work and in an effort to fit in or at least not stick out too much I also do my best to brown bag it. I didn't know how seriously to take the description of whiskey on the label yet as the beer settles in the glass I see what was meant and I can only wonder the type of lunch I would've packed if I had waited until after I have enjoyed this drink. It would have been night guy pulling a fast one on day guy [Seinfeld link]. Alas I have decided to be responsibly irresponsible: my next day’s meal is prepared and I'm drinking on a school night.

After the initial build in spice the heat has not continued to escalate and as a result the beer does not become intolerable far from it. So I would not classify this as a primarily spicy beer but I can definitely see how it would be too much for people Who do not appreciate a little kick. On second thought I may have to rescind that last comment I believe this does qualify as a spicy beer.

## Het Uiltje - Ransuil, Long eared owl (Oak aged Imperial/double stout)

https://www.uiltjecraftbeer.com/

<sub>Image source: https://www.uiltjecraftbeer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/bosuil.jpg </sub>

Dutch point: you even get good beer in the department store! HEMA [http://www.hema.nl/]; he first time I was introduced to this brewery was actually in Hema. The idea of finding good beer in a department store is pretty alien to someone from the United States. But this is just one of the rough cultural differences I need to to get used to if I'm going to make it here and be happy. 

It's been raining again most of the week, most of the month, most of the summer. Despite the long days much of it has been overcast and gray. It appears that my selection of beers fits right in to the weather theme of the summer, dark & stormy. 

# WEATHER: LONDON

True to its label the beer has the distinctive  oak-aged stout flavor. I prefer a Bourbon barrel aged stout but it's nice to change it up and so they'll be no objections from here. Unlike the other beers discussed in this post I have decided to pair this drink with some food. In case I end up not sharing the photo let me mention that it is cake. And I’m keeping it classy [Ron Burgundy] by not bothering with a plate, instead eating it directly from the tinfoil it was saved in.

<img src="/gallery/2016/sixpack/het_uiltje_bosuil.jpg">

One of the reasons I prefer bourbon barrel to oak when aging a stout is the resulting flavor in the latter. For me oak seems to give the beer a somewhat leathery or musky aroma. I'm not sure if that description of the smell is quite accurate. Though I can often recognize the flavors present in beers it is sometimes difficult to put the accurate labels on them. It is something akin to flavor dejavu. An occupational hazard I suppose. I'll have to look into how other people describe this perceived phenomenon so that I can make my slight objection (after all) a bit more refined and pointed. 

Back to the department store, I was understandably a bit resistant to the idea of purchasing beer when I saw it stacked alongside other knickknacks such as socks and stationary. However two things swayed me towards making the purchase. First was the style: black IPA. Second: the price. I mean who doesn't like a good deal and if the product turns out to be halfway decent even better, right? 

Speaking of price it's one of the small beer adjustments I have had to make. Similar to back home, beers are cheaper at a store than at the bar but the price difference is not nearly as great as what I’m accustomed to and as a result I often feel I’m getting a better deal at a bar, even with the higher price because of the larger selection than what I tend to keep at home. Chalk it up to predictably irrational [link] human perception. All in all prices are cheaper here than back in New York, there are few places that would not be true, both at the bar and at the bottle shops. The difference is that the bars tend to charge quite a bit less than in the city but the bottle shops don't provide much of a discount at all (again to what I've become accustomed to). As a result, and since things are relative, I tend to appreciate the bar prices a bit more.

Enough with all that, how about the beer? Smooth of course, very clean, solid mouth feel, and not at all watery. Has a serious 10.5 punch that is quite sneaky. You don't taste the strength but it is there lurking if you're not paying attention. The label, how long did you think I would go without mentioning that, refers to the hoppiness but I have to be honest I don't get too much of that yet it needs to be graded on a curve and for a double/Imperial Stout I can see that it does contain a nice hoppy-ness. 

So how did the purchase from HEMA go? Quite well, not only was I introduced to the black IPA from Het Uiltje but also a Thai spice triple from another brewery (need to look up which one). Don’t hesitate to grab a beer with your next purchase of socks the next time you’re in a Dutch department store. 

## ‘t IJ - IPA

http://www.brouwerijhetij.nl/?lang=en

We are now at the end, the final beer, and it is bittersweet. Not only the selection (IPA) but also the way it's been received and rated by others. I wanted to say last but not least, unfortunately both last and least seems to be how many people have come to appreciate this selection. It's a shame for me personally since this is one of the first beers that made me realize that in a land  with so much traditional brewing there was definitely a craft beer scene, and a damn good one at that. As I have mentioned before,  perhaps I am too lenient and overly forgiving in my appreciation. I  would likely be the bizarro-Russian judge when it came to scoring performances.

# DATA MODEL ML GRID

What we have here, at least in my opinion, is a damn solid IPA. Light orange in color, light and fluffy  white foam, with inviting floral notes. When it comes to criticism I must admit that I have found this beer to be a tad inconsistent, perhaps something to do with the bottling and or distribution. This is unfortunate in such a crowded market where it is rare to get a  second chance to change someone's mind, especially if they do not often have an opportunity to come across your beer. This certainly makes quality job one.
