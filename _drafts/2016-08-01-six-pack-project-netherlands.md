## The Dutch Know Beer

The Netherlands has a long standing beer history [link] and the only non-Belgian Trappist brewery, La Trappe [link] to prove it. Beer culture in Holland manifests itself in many ways: from the beheometh Heineken, to the  aforementioned Trappist brewery, from its presence at fine and low restaurants, to the ever burgeoning microbrew scene. 

## Reuz Stout

It's the beginning of June and I'm drinking a stout. A barrel appears on the label but this version of the beer is not aged. However it does come in at a respectable 9.5% ABV. Predictably black, this good looking stout give off hints of dark brown around the edges, and especially at the top of the glass. The smell is familiar to anyone who's had a respectable stout and explored beyond Guinness (footnote: no disrespect to Guinness. It’s just that there’s more to stout than Irish stouts, is all). It is definitely sweet but by no means cloying, has a nice mouthfeel, and a light roasted touch. Smooth is definitely a word that comes to mind. When I suggest that it has a caramel flavor I have the Belgian doubles in mind and if not caramel then perhaps toffee. 

Do not think that because I gravitate to the label so quickly I do not enjoy the beer but rather that I respect and appreciate the amount of information provided, as well as the detail and the display of the data. For instance, everything is clearly defined, from alcohol percentage, to storage temperature, as well as the glass and temperature it should be served in. Below that we have a different set of categories that provide us with diet details, number of calories, and IBU’s. One of my favorite things about European beer bottles are the prohibition symbols indicating who should not be drinking. For instance there is the silhouette of a pregnant lady in profile, an image of a car, and the number 18. Each of these are surrounded by a red circle with a slash across them, reminiscent of the Ghostbusters symbol, suggesting that we don't want these ghosts. 

It doesn't take long,  just a couple of sips and a little bit of reflection to realize that the well hidden alcohol behind the delicious flavors is having its effect and once again I gravitate to the label. Now I'm attracted by the image and no longer care about the numbers and descriptions of the beer itself. Here’s what we have to look at. On the frontside of the label a giant reclines while drinking,  there is a dwarf sitting on one of his knees, himself sitting and drinking. The giant looks merry, the dwarf the same, and I am happy to be in their company. Time for another sip. 

A third of the way through the beer and with its continued warming the flavors begin to mature further. Additionally the mouth feel of the beer becomes more pronounced and leaves a fine, not unpleasant, coating. The beer is clean in its flavors, its aftertaste, and the lacing, or lack thereof, on the glass.

Again it is June here, the beginning of June. This means that it is not quite summer though the weather is showing signs of warming and has occasionally broken into the 80’s. So why am I drinking such a dark beer, a strong beer? For one, I enjoy the style. For another, this is not always the warmest place to be – I'm referring to the Netherlands of course
