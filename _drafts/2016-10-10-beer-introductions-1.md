title: A Guide for the Beer Perplexed
subtitle: Part I - Looking at Beer Style Connections 
---

Beer is delicious but it is not one thing. If you disagree with the former part of the previous sentence please keep the latter in mind. Think of sports, for instance. Many would agree with the blanket statement "sports are fun" but depending on what you have in mind two people can easily have opposite reactions to being presented the opportunity to play ping-pong. Sports are not one thing, music is not one thing, and neither is beer.

Presented with a finely crafted brew in a style of your preference it is difficult to have a more pleasurable gastronomical experience. Throw off one of those two criteria, craftsmanship or style preference, and you're likely to have a tolerable experience at best or an off-putting one at worst (first world problems are nevertheless fraught with disappointment).<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> Setting aside craftsmanship for another time, I will be focusing on beer styles and helping you find ones suitable to your preferences, current and developing. Think of me as your craft beer sherpa and the visuals below simply as my tools. 

The (over?) abundance of beers now available makes it understandable if one is overwhelmed by the choices. Forget about picking just between two options (Bud Light or Bud Heavy, really no option at all), you have dozens upon dozens of choices (take that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buridan%27s_ass" target="_blank">Buridan’s ass</a>!). You could easily be stopped before even beginning. I am here to provide a helping hand with some simple analysis to ward off any onset of paralysis. 

Discovering that beer does not have to taste bad is something that happens on a regular and enthusiastic basis if the year-over-year growth in craft beer business is any indication. The hurdle to personal discovery and preference, as is so often the case, can appear to be a daunting one, even for something as delicious and intoxicating (literally) as "real" beer. I can speak from experience and say the options available can be equal parts intimidating and frustrating (then you have a couple and it doesn't seem so frustrating after all). 

With innumerable options and not knowing where to begin it is forgivable to simply throw one’s hands up and  rush into any old style. This tactic, while commendable for its action and much better than doing nothing (including, heaven forbid, not drinking beer at all), has the unfortunate effect of being unfocused and leaving you to the whims of external vagaries. There is the added likelihood of running into a beer style that is not a particularly good match, resulting in disappointment and pushing you back, short term let’s hope, into the familiar but underwhelming arms of a light lager. One is made more painfully aware of all this with hindsight. To begin imbibing craft beer is to bring on short term pleasure, medium term disappointment in reflecting on all the lost opportunities, and, finally, gleeful acceptance of never going back.
