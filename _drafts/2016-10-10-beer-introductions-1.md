title: [A] Guide for the [Beer] Perplexed
subtitle: Looking at Beer Styles

Beer is delicious but it is not one thing. If you disagree with the former part of the previous sentence please keep the latter in mind. Think of sports, for instance. Many would agree with the blanket statement "sports are fun" but depending on what you have in mind two people can easily have opposite reactions to being presented the opportunity to play ping-pong. Sports are not one thing, music is not one thing, and neither is beer.

Presented with a finely crafted brew in a style of your preference it is difficult to have a more pleasurable gastronomical experience. Throw off one of those two criteria, craftsmanship or style preference, and you're likely to have a tolerable experience at best or an off-putting one at worst.  [FN: 1. First world problems. 2. I have used some version of this intro in submissions to other sites but never on my own so I feel no shame in self-plagiarising myself here.]
