Most things are better when they're shared. This goes doubly for beer. Company makes the beer better and the beer typically returns the favor. Just remember to "wrap it up" [Chappelle] to avoid too many unintended longterm consequences. When it comes to company I will leave it to you and your interests regarding what to discuss and interact. With respect to beer I am here to provide a helping hand. Discovering that beer does not have to taste bad is something that happens on a regular basis if the year-over-year growth in craft beer is to be witnessed. The hurdle to discovery, as is so often the case, can appear to be a daunting one, even for something as delicious and intoxicating (literally) as "real" beer. In the instance of this topic I can speak from experience and say the options available can be equal parts daunting and intimidating. Making one rush into any old style that may not be a particularly good match or back into the disappointing [fn: something made more painfully aware with hindsight; so to begin imbiding craft is to bring on short term pleasure, medium term disappointment in reflecting on all the lost opportunities, and finally gleeful acceptance of never giong back; {look at stages of grieving}] but familiar arms of a light lager. 

Notes:
- having a sherpa/guru, a Morpheus to one's Neo
- return of the prodigal son; the greater appreciation of one not "born into it"
- to give is better than to receive, be the sherpa
- challenges to learning
- find a beachhead, something currently imbided
- go slow and recommend along the same style, don't jump straight into a hop bomb, imperial stout, or sour
