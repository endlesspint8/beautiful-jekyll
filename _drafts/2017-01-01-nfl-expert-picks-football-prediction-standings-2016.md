## Experts Know Things, Right?

What we hope to discover in this season-long investigation into _American_ football game predictions is which major outlet has the best brain trust. By major outlet we mean the networks that carry the games: CBS, ESPN, FOX and NBC<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>; and best, at least initially, will be determined by how well the respective crews, as a collective, do against game results. Game results should be self explanatory and in addition we will be looking at performance against the spread, where applicable. What exactly "as a collective" means is simple enough to guess at but will be explained further below after introducing the prediction sources and explaining a bit about the data sets. 

To begin with we have 2 human panels, CBS and ESPN, and 2 data models/simulations, FiveThirtyEight and FOX. CBS offers straight up (SUP) and against the spread (ATS) picks, ESPN only SUP. CBS and ESPN have 8- and 9-men<sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup> expert crews, respectively. We will be tracking all of the picks on an individual (each expert's choice) and collective level, taking each expert's pick as a vote for that game. Regarding the latter voting process, we will be using the percentage of votes for a specific team as a proxy for that panel's expected winning probability. Due to CBS having an even number of experts, introducing the very likely scenario of 50/50 splits, we will give the push to the away team (this may be complimented later by adding a scenario where the push goes to the underdog of the betting line, stay tuned). At least initially the CBS split decisions of 50/50 will not be a problem as we will be using the <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=brier%20score" target="_score">Brier score</a> (BS) to determine forecast probabilistic accuracy and this method takes this eventuality into consideration.

Both FiveThirtyEight and FOX provide their predictions as a probability. FiveThirtyEight relies on ELO ratings and besides winning expectations also provides ELO based point spreads (how this part will be analyzed is yet to be determined). FOX is partnered with XYZ and I am looking to get more information on their methodoloy but it is stated that the percentages and scores are based on 501 game simulations. Both data models/simulations, FiveThirtyEight and FOX, released their predictions for the entire season ahead of any live snaps and will be updated throughout the season. I intend to track the performances of both the pre-released data picks (referred to here as "a priori") and those updated on a week-to-week basis (referred to as "in situ"). 

Perhaps you're already seeing how much of this will play out based on what's been described above. The probabilities for each of the 4 initial sources will be compared to actual game results to determine the effectiveness of the predictions. Should you not have bothered to click on the Brier score link above let us summarize it by saying that a) the more confident the predictions, the greater the  reward/penalty based on outcome, & b) the lower the BS (Brier score or bullshit, you deside) the better. There will be 8 anticipated predictive performances to track (this also may grow, stay tuned): 

  1. CBS SUP 
  2. CBS ATS
  3. ESPN SUP
  4. FiveThirtyEight "a priori"
  5. FiveThirtyEight "in situ"
  6. FOX "a priori"
  7. FOX "in situ"
  8. Random probability prediction
  
We are interested in a number of anticipated comparisons (expert panel v. expert panel, humans v. algorithms, algo v. algo, and of course all against the random predictor which is expected to come in last but is presented here as a sort of baseline) and expect others to come to the fore as the season proceeds. Chart, tables, and occasional interactive visualizations will be made available on weekly basis (Tuesdays) for the duration of the season. Each week will provide an opportunity to look at the football season in a new light.
