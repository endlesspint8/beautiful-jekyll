## Experts Know Things, Right?

What we hope to discover in this season-long investigation into _American_ football game predictions is which major outlet has the best brain trust? By major outlet we mean the networks that carry the games: CBS, ESPN, FOX and NBC; and best, at least initially, will be determined by how well the respective crews, as a collective, do against game results. Game results should be self explanatory and in addition we will be looking at performance against the spread, where applicable. What exactly "as a collective" means is simple enough to guess at but will be explained further below after introducing the prediction sources and explaining a bit about the data sets. 

To begin with we have 2 human panels, CBS and ESPN, and 2 data models/simulations, FiveThirtyEight and FOX. CBS offers straight up (SUP) and against the spread (ATS) picks, ESPN only SUP. CBS and ESPN have 8- and 9-men[fn: they are in fact all men] expert crews, respectively. We will be tracking all of the picks on an individual, each expert's choice, and collective level, taking each expert's pick as a vote for that game. Regarding the latter voting process, we will be using the percentage of votes for a specific team as a proxy for that panel's expected winning probability. Due to CBS having an even number of experts, introducing the very likely scenarios of 50/50 splits, we will give the push to the away team (this may be complimented later by adding a scenario where the push goes to the underdog of the betting line, stay tuned). At least initially the even 

Both FiveThirtyEight and FOX provide their predictions as a probability. FiveThirtyEight relies on ELO ratings and besides winning expectations also provides ELO based point spreads. FOX is partnered with XYZ and I am looking to get more information on their methodoloy but it is stated that the percentages and game scores are based on 501 game simulations. Both data models/simulations, FiveThirtyEight and FOX, will be updated throughout the season in addition to having released their picks for the entire season before
