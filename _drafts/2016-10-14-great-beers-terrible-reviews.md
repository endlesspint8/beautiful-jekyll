### LIST

Inspired by BuzzFeed 2015 "_One-Star Amazon Reviews Of Classic Novels Are Hilarious_" [article](https://www.buzzfeed.com/margaretmaurer/one-star-amazon-reviews-of-classic-novels-18660?utm_term=.gnyqBma0vE#.psRMOdRGjr).

Took 10 overlapping top beers from BeerAdvocate (BA) and RateBeer (RB) to create our list below.

Westvleteren 12 (XII)	(Abt/Quadrupel)

> "Pipi in a bottle" http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/beer_name/4934/291926/
>
> "shit beer dont know why its rated so good i guess im use to canadian beer cause canadian best drinkers in the world bitc hes" http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/beer_name/4934/89500/

Toppling Goliath Mornin’ Delight	Imperial Stout

> "Just as the Americans like it, sweet as hell and full of things that just don’t belong in a beer, such as coffee flavor. It is very aromatic though, and if you like that a beer tastes like hot chocolate coffee with beer flavor, then this is the stuff for you. Soon to find in your next Sturbucks!" http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/beer_name/151817/390708/

Cigar City Hunahpu’s Imperial Stout - Double Barrel Aged	Imperial Stout

> "Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. What a failure. Cinnamon², cardemom², chili². Overspiced², hence flavour profile is completely out of balance. The average mean of this beer is ridicilously high. Wondering if all ratings of this beer are done by aliens. Or America = Aliens? The truth is out there. Go get them Mulder. X Thanks berntholer for this extraterrestrial." http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/beer_name/249005/235224/

Three Floyds Dark Lord Russian Imperial Stout (Bourbon Barrel Aged)	Imperial Stout

> "Tasted like generic cough syrup mixed with old coffee and a shot of whiskey - and not in a good way" http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/beer_name/58590/237963/
>
> "I was not impressed and actually gave the rest of my pour to my friend Kev." http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/beer_name/58590/45198/
