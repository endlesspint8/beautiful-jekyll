### LIST

Inspired by BuzzFeed 2015 "_One-Star Amazon Reviews Of Classic Novels Are Hilarious_" [article](https://www.buzzfeed.com/margaretmaurer/one-star-amazon-reviews-of-classic-novels-18660?utm_term=.gnyqBma0vE#.psRMOdRGjr).

Took 10 overlapping top beers from BeerAdvocate (BA) and RateBeer (RB) to create our list below.

Toppling Goliath Mornin’ Delight	Imperial Stout

> "Just as the Americans like it, sweet as hell and full of things that just don’t belong in a beer, such as coffee flavor. It is very aromatic though, and if you like that a beer tastes like hot chocolate coffee with beer flavor, then this is the stuff for you. Soon to find in your next Sturbucks!" http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/beer_name/151817/390708/
