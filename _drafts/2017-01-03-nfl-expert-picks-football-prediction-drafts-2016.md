## Week 4 - I'm Just a Professional

_That's what everyone keeps saying and I'm getting sick and tired of hearing it_. Now that I'm done channeling my inner <a href="https://youtu.be/DYa6FNKSgbk" target="_blank">John Creasy</a> let's get on with what is turning into a less than impressive showing for the game pickers. I guess there's a reason people get paid big bucks for calling it <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417217/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_26" target="_blank">like it is</a>, while the rest of us make cute little visualizations about others' struggles. 

Week 4, first week with a Bye so we had 15 games instead of the usual 16. Who broke even? Not CBS or FiveThirtyEight. Uh-uh, each of them had only 7 wins SUP. FOX did them one better and our big winner was ESPN with 9 wins for a weekly winning percentage of 60%. That wouldn't even get me a passing grade in Spanish class. Los siento, expertos! [fn: Damn. I wish I could enter an upside down exclamation point for this sentence] 

On the season the experts/models are not much more impressive. Each of them are lingering, like a stale fart, at 35-37 wins. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOoqtsNReIU" target="_blank">Shiiit</a>, my random generator has 28 wins alone. [fn: Two MM references in the same week. Let's make that the record.]

Above is a representation of the weekly (x-axis) performances by source (y-axis). The larger the cirlce the more wins for the given source/week.

<img src="/gallery/2016/football-picks/bs_wins_key.png" alt="bs_wins_key" /><br>

The lighter and more yellow the color the better performing on the Brier Score (BS), darker and green colors represent the opposite.

<img src="/gallery/2016/football-picks/bs_score_key.png" alt="bs_score_key" /><br>

On the right side of the main plot we have a second chart that summarizes the season to date. Each bar is in line with the sources on the original y-axis and their length represents total wins SUP. The color saturation follows the same meaning as for the circles. 

Bear in mind however, that the colors are relative to the universe of inputs. For instance, in a world where G-d is making game predictions and is getting everything right, naturally, he/she would have a BS of 0, because again it's G-d, and the yellow would represent that low of a number. Meanwhile, someone who got every pick 100% wrong, <a href="https://youtu.be/8PLSyFzk-6g?t=1m7s" target="_blank">a mush</a>, would have a BS of 1 and a color of dark green, ironically the color of money. Those colors are represented above, but again they are relative to the universe of these 5 sources. This decision was made to make differentiation more easy.


## Week 3 - Well, That Escalated Quickly

Rough week for the favorites, human prognasticators, and predictions in general. Where should we even start? Ten of 16 games were unanimously agreed upon (SUP) by the panels/models, but half of them proved incorrect. Meaning if we were using the unanimous model selections there would be a just better than one-third chance (34%, 0.875x0.778x0.5) of making it to Week 4 in a suicide pool. This is definitely something that's made me repeatedly curious, you can expect a graphic of some sort in the coming weeks. 

We mentioned getting into the betting line and this is us tipping in our toe. Of the 16 betting line favorites 9 lost outright, 6 of which were home favorites. The breakdown of the aforementioned favorite performances by week to date:

|Week|Betting Line Favorite W's SUP|Home Favorite W's SUP|
|---|---|---|
|Week 1 | 62.5% (10/16)| 55.6% (5/9)|
|Week 2 | 62.5% (10/16)| 66.7% (8/12)|
|Week 3 | 43.8% (7/16)| 50% (6/12)|

Below is an interactive graph showing game outcomes by home teams through week 3. The x-axis displays the number of points the home team was either favored or not-favored by. The y-axis displays the point difference (PTD) of the final game score for the home team (positive for wins, negative for loses; it's not rocket surgery, stick with me). The 4 quadrants created by these two axes, starting in the top right box and moving clockwise, are winning favorites (+x, +y), losing favorites (+x, -y), losing dogs (-x, -x), and winning dogs (-x, +y). The color/shape of the marks indicate conference (red circles for AFC, blue squares for NFC). Game details such as teams, final score, and home line can be identified by hovering over the marks. Lastly, there is a 45-degree dashed line bisecting quadrants I and III, winning favorites and losing dogs, respectively. This is the home line that identifies wins/loses against the spread (ATS). The size of the circles/boxes are an indication of how greatly the final PTD differed from the home line.

Plans are to update this graph weekly, leaving a static image in its place to capture the week 3 snapshot:

The two data models, FiveThirtyEight & FOX, performed best, both for wins and Brier Score (BS). Meanwhile, the humans of CBS and ESPN proved easily swayed by favorites, picking 14 of 16 to win (though there was a slight discprency on two of the choices). As we have noted in numerous places in this piece the experts are prone to unanimous votes of their own, something we have been smoothing to help damper the impact of such situations. Despite the "dampering" both data models leap frogged our previous front runner, CBS, putting themselves in the top too spots followed by the expert panels, with not much to differentiate this latter pair. The Random game picker incidentally made the greatest gains (keep in mind a low Brier Score, BS, is preferable) and following another similar week may be breathing down the necks of the "experts" (too soon for quotes? time will tell).

**TODO**: create 1-season "refreshing" win standings, to show variation, using win prob

1. loop through games and pick winner based on prob & Math.random()
2. winning team += 1
3. pass team & wins, along with conf & div, to json (maybe?)
4. [create table](http://www.d3noob.org/2013/02/add-html-table-to-your-d3js-graph.html) from json
5. [sort table](http://www.d3noob.org/2013/02/more-d3js-table-madness-sorting.html) by conf, div, wins
6. apply color coding: font per conf; row per div winners

## Week 2 - Back to the Future Full Season Recap 

As we plod along tracking game prediction accuracies week-to-week it may be tempting to get lost in the most current data and side tracked by the latest revisions. With that idea in mind let us now take a moment to look forward and document what the two quant models, by FiveThirtyEight and FOX, predicted for the season by using their respecitve game-by-game winning probabilities.

FiveThirtyEight provides a team-by-team season win total, released preseason and updated weekly. No need to reinvent the wheel, however there is, to the best of my web surfing, no breakdown of how this looks by conference and/or division. That could be meaningful for playoff purposes. Below is table of the preseason expected wins for FiveThirtyEight. Teams are grouped first by conference, then by division, and sorted by overall wins, followed by division and conference wins. I have highlighted the division winners and the additional two wild card teams per conference.

**FiveThirtyEight Game Probability Season Standings**

<sub>Data Source: <a href="http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-nfl-predictions/" target="_blank">FiveThirtyEight</a></sub>

FOX does not even provide an overall win total for the teams, again to the best of my web surfing, which made this excercise worthwhile just to see where they stand big picture. The table is similarily grouped and sorted. By the way, the wins for both tables were calculated with the following <a href="https://gist.github.com/endlesspint8/2eaae1e452ce7d5a5edd46277c0459fb#file-nfl_season_standings_w_prob-py" target="_blank">code</a>.

**FOX Game Probability Season Standings**

<img src="/gallery/2016/football-picks/FOX_prob.PNG" alt="FOX prob" /><br>
<sub>Data Source: <a href="http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/predictions" target="_blank">FOX</a></sub>

Clearly a good amount of overlap but also some interesting differences in details to keep in mind moving forward (win distributions by conference and division; outcome of competitive divisions [NFC East, especially]). 

**Notes & Updates to Last Week**

FiveThirtyEight's model improved against its preseason predictions in both wins, making one game prediction change (from CHI to PHI), and BS. FOX recalibrated from its preseason predictions with less success. FOX's model made two game prediction changes, but only one of them turned out to be correct (IND to DEN). Additionally, the probabilites for wins were further off post-recalibration. CBS continues to hold strong, slightly edging out FiveThirtyEight's model with respect to BS and predicting three more games correctly. 

**Predictive Standing, Straight Up**

|Source|Season Brier Score|Season Wins|
|---|---|---|
|CBS (regularized)|0.218|23|
|FiveThirtyEight (in situ)|0.219|20|
|FiveThirtyEight (a priori)|0.221|19|
|CBS|0.232|23|
|ESPN (regularized)|0.236|20|
|FOX (a priori)|0.255|17|
|ESPN|0.256|20|
|FOX (in situ)|0.262|17|
|Random|0.402|12|

Things to be looking out for: 
* quant model recalibrations and subsequent performance (FiveThirtyEight has a 1.00 win% on changes; FOX is at 0.50, granted on a _tiny_ sample set)
* random predictive performance (improved from last week)
* continue to monitor human/experts against regularized  panel probabilities, possibly drop outright votes based on future performance
* suicide pool survival based on unanimous picks (& win% for same)
    * Unanimous picks: Week 1, 7/8 correct (87.5%); Week 2, 7/11 correct (77.8%)
