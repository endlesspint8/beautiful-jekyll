**Notes**

FiveThirtyEight's model improved against its preseason predictions in both wins, switching from xx to yy, and BS. FOX recalibrated from its preseason predictions with less success. FOX's model made two game prediction changes, but only one of them turned out to be correct. Additionally, the probabilites for wins was a bit more off post-recalibration. CBS continues to hold strong and while slightly edged out by FiveThirtyEight's model with respect to BS holds a three game lead when it comes to wins. 

Things we will be looking out for: quant model recalibrations and subsequent performance (FiveThirtyEight has a 1.00 win% on changes; FOX is at 0.50) // random predictive performance (improved from last week) // continue to monitor human/experts against regularized  panel probabilities, possibly drop outright votes based on future performance // 

**Predictive Standing, Straight Up**

## Week 2 - Back to the Future Full Season Recap 

As we plod along tracking game prediction accuracies week-to-week it may be tempting to get lost in the most current data and side tracked by the latest revisions. With that idea in mind let us now take a moment to look forward and document what the two quant models, by FiveThirtyEight and FOX, predicted for the season by using their respecitve game by game winning probabilities. 

**TODO**: create 1-season "refreshing" win standings, to show variation, using win prob
