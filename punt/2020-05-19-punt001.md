## 004: Market watch

**There's no shame** in price shopping. If you're too proud to get down into the haggling yourself you can wait around and let the market do its dance. Betting lines absolutely have moves, which only complicates the betting decision process. The poor bet a few days back is now looking more attractive or vice versa. Naturally, this is where a system and discipline chip in to help keep your sanity and minimize regret. 

Below are line movements across two dozen sports books for the Wilder Fury rematch. We see the decimal odds from 30+ days out until fight night. 

I'll let you draw your own anecdotal conclusions. The only observation I wish to reiterate is that markets make moves. Appreciating this should make anyone a more shrewd bettor.

## 003: Price Shopping

**One bet is** never going to be enough. I am not referring to any sort of addictive behaviour but rather the simple appreciation that given an accurate accessment of expected value you're going to need substantial attempts to make sure the numbers work in your favor. In the long run. Ultimately it may be a question of whether you can stay solvent long enough to turn a profit.

Calling Mr. Rithmetic. Sir, please tell us the expectation of a wager. "Certainly. All you need to do is plug in the appropriate numbers into the following:"

> _p_(PROFIT) - (1 - _p_)(LOSS) = _E_

Example using our previous +200 underdog who we thought had a 40% chance of victory:

> (0.4)(200) - (.6)(100) = 80 - 60 = 20

Nice. Looks familiar. I love it when the math matches up. "Me too."

Now for another mundane example. A slightly skewed coin for which we're making $1 bets for even odds. The odds are slightly in your favor, 51/49. What we can see and appreciate from the chart below is that even with (slightly) favorable odds there is no guarantee of making a profit. The chances are less the fewer times you play but even after 1,000 flips there is a substantial chance (25+%) that despite "making the right decision" and "behaving rationally" you will be facing a loss.

This chart reminds me that expected value works, in the long run; that making the right decisoins can still lead to undesired outcomes; even with favorable odds, if you've dug yourself a hole it's gonna take a while to get out of it; that finding and leveraging, repeatedly, the largest expected values is the way to give yourself the best chance of being profitable. 


## 002: Seeking value

**How much you're** willing to pay for something depends heavily on what you think the thing is worth. Channeling my inner Howard Marks I can say that there are price points at which a bad bet becomes attractive and a good bet unattractive. What determines the attractiveness of a bet is the perceived value, the gap, or lack thereof, between what it costs and the expected return. More simply, it is the payout times the probability of the favorable outcome. Examples of simple arithetic always go a long way to highlighting the point. 

Let's say we have decimal odds of 3.0 (+200), meaning a 2/1 underdog. Ignoring the bookmaker's take and the prospect of draws for the time being we see the market is saying that 33% of the time the dog will win. If this were correct or, more relevantly, something you agreed with then there would be no point making the bet. Having three similar bets play out naively as expected would result in two losses and a win. The win would cover your losses (again, ignoring the vig) and you would be back where you started. 

However, if you believed the dog had a better shot, let's say a 40% chance of winning, then there is value in the bet. Value can be determined by a simple equation that calculates whether a bet falls above 1.0 or not. 

> _**Value bet**: decimal odds * probability of outcome > 1.0_

Taking the numbers to date, and our higher estimation of the dog, we get the following:

> _3.0 * .4 = 1.2_

The inverse holds; if the perceived probability is below the market/line then a bet's value will fall below 1.0 and should not be taken. Naturally, this all looks so simple when laid out. We can even draw the conclusion that what we want are as many high value bets as possible. Simple but not easy. The challenges start popping up when considering the added wrinkles of time, price movements, costs, and effective handicapping. Not easy but interesting.

Not even interesting but compelling. For me this is the crux of the entire exercise: quantifiying outcome probabilities and having the belief in one's approach to back them. Not just with reputation, which may be adequate in many situations, but with actual money. The bets are for keeping score of activity, accuracy, and consistency. It's about decision making _and_ action, neither in isolation. 


## 001: Setting a framework

**Coming on five** years of putting out EP material. There have been a variety of techniques, visuals, and tools used. Predictably, the topics have revolved around craft beer. The two other prevelant topics have been books and boxing. I like to keep my interests to one letter. The time and energy required, and available, has generally pointed me towards one-off posts. Themes recur and topics are revisited but any coherence is usually present in retrospect. 

None of the time or energy constraints have changed markedly. While effectively under the same restrictions I wish to alter my approach, at least for some dedicated near term window. Many of the previous motivations (practicing my skills, exposing myself to new data sets, applying machine learning techniques, and finding ways of visualizing take-aways) remain. I simply want to direct them towards a more consistent goal.

In an effort to continue doing the side project work I have found so entertaining and also build something more substantial, something that extends beyond a couple of posts, I have turned my attention to punting. On boxing. The two together are a natural fit for my continued data science-y pursuits. Many of the techniques and tools previously implemented are applicable. Some old scripts will be dusted off. Even so, a whole lot of learning and mistakes will be had. 

This will be an iterative process. I will be learning as I go along, learning by doing. I will undoubtedly be making statements and pursuing avenues that will make me look like a fool. If I am lucky and persistent one of the people to identify these foolish pursuits will be my future self. To that end, I will outline the way I currently see the "problem" at hand. This would appear to be a three-part process that feeds in on one another:

* handicapping
* market prices
* bankroll management

Each of these will be discussed in further detail and in turns in the weeks and months to come. _Handicapping_ is about coming up with a "secret sauce" to help determine the odds on any given bout. _Market prices_ refers to what lines can be found at various books, their movement and any limits (which will hardly be a consideration in the beginning, or ever?). Lastly, _bankroll management_ has to do with the amount, or rather percentage, of available funds to put at risk, whether there is any value in a given fight, and some attention to emotions and cognitive biases.
