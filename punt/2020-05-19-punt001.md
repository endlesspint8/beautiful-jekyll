## 003: Market watch

## 002: Seeking value

**How much you're** willing to pay for something depends heavily on what you think the thing is worth. Channeling my inner Howard Marks I can say that there are price points at which a bad bet becomes attractive and a good bet unattractive. What determines the attractiveness of a bet is the perceived value, the gap, or lack thereof, between what it costs and the expected return. More simply, it is the payout times the probability of the favorable outcome. Examples of simple arithetic always go a long way to highlighting the point. 

Let's say we have decimal odds of 3.0 (+200), meaning a 2/1 underdog. Ignoring the bookmaker's take and the prospect of draws for the time being we see the market is saying that 33% of the time the dog will win. If this were correct or, more relevantly, something you agreed with then there would be no point making the bet. Having three similar bets play out naively as expected would result in two losses and a win. The win would cover your losses (again, ignoring the vig) and you would be back where you started. 

However, if you believed the dog had a better shot, let's say a 40% chance of winning, then there is value in the bet. Value can be determined by a simple equation that calculates whether a bet falls above 1.0 or not. 

> _**Value bet**: decimal odds * probability of outcome > 1.0_

Taking the numbers to date, and our higher estimation of the dog, we get the following:

> _3.0 * .4 = 1.2_

The inverse holds; if the perceived probability is below the market/line then a bet's value will fall below 1.0 and should not be taken. Naturally, this all looks so simple when laid out. We can even draw the conclusion that what we want are as many high value bets as possible. Simple but not easy. The challenges start popping up when considering the added wrinkles of time, price movements, costs, and effective handicapping. Not easy but interesting.

## 001: Setting a framework

**Coming on five** years of putting out EP material. There have been a variety of techniques, visuals, and tools used. Predictably, the topics have revolved around craft beer. The two other prevelant topics have been books and boxing. I like to keep my interests to one letter. The time and energy required, and available, has generally pointed me towards one-off posts. Themes recur and topics are revisited but any coherence is usually present in retrospect. 

None of the time or energy constraints have changed markedly. While effectively under the same restrictions I wish to alter my approach, at least for some dedicated near term window. Many of the previous motivations (practicing my skills, exposing myself to new data sets, applying machine learning techniques, and finding ways of visualizing take-aways) remain. I simply want to direct them towards a more consistent goal.

In an effort to continue doing the side project work I have found so entertaining and also build something more substantial, something that extends beyond a couple of posts, I have turned my attention to punting. On boxing. The two together are a natural fit for my continued data science-y pursuits. Many of the techniques and tools previously implemented are applicable. Some old scripts will be dusted off. Even so, a whole lot of learning and mistakes will be had. 

This will be an iterative process. I will be learning as I go along, learning by doing. I will undoubtedly be making statements and pursuing avenues that will make me look like a fool. If I am lucky and persistent one of the people to identify these foolish pursuits will be my future self. To that end, I will outline the way I currently see the "problem" at hand. This would appear to be a three-part process that feeds in on one another:

* handicapping
* market prices
* bankroll management

Each of these will be discussed in further detail and in turns in the weeks and months to come. _Handicapping_ is about coming up with a "secret sauce" to help determine the odds on any given bout. _Market prices_ refers to what lines can be found at various books, their movement and any limits (which will hardly be a consideration in the beginning, or ever?). Lastly, _bankroll management_ has to do with the amount, or rather percentage, of available funds to put at risk, whether there is any value in a given fight, and some attention to emotions and cognitive biases.
