I'm a data dilettante and craft beer fan. The intersection of these two interests _influenced_ me to put this site together. 

Big whoop. Enjoy.

I am fascinated by human behavior and expression. I see data as another artifact of human actions and systems, both social and technic. 

By using available data, creating visualizations and applying machine learning techniques I write data-infused essays related to one of humans' longest standing endeavors, the creation and enjoyable consumption of beer.
