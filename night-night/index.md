|   |   |   |   |
| Saudi America | Bethany McLean  | AUDIOBOOK  | Heard author on podcast; short and sweet.  |
|	The Broom of the System	|	David Foster Wallace	|	PRINT	|	After his essay collections (Lobster & Fun Thing) I thought it about time to tackle one of his fiction works.	|
|	The True History of Chocolate	|	Sophie D. Coe	|	EBOOK	|	One of the [bitter](/tag/bitter) cousins. It was alright, a bit of a let-down in comparison to Uncommon Grounds (coffee).	|
|	Touching a Nerve	|	Patricia S. Churchland	|	AUDIOBOOK	|	Love me some consciousness exploration.	|
|	Bayesian Analysis with Python (1st ed.) |	Osvaldo Martin	|	PRINTED	|	One of the six subject areas I'm particularly keen on at the moment. Also, found early perusals to show this as a strong text on fundimentals of the topic.	|
|	Hellblazer (1988), Volume 1	|	Jamie Delano	|	EBOOK	|	The Sandman (1989), Volume 1: wasn't familiar with J. Constantine when he popped up in the story + [Forbidden Planet 50]	|
|	Dune Messiah |	Frank Herbert | EBOOK	| DUNE |
| White Teeth | Zadie Smith | PRINT | |
|	Batman: The Killing Joke	|	Alan Moore	|	EBOOK	|	[Forbidden Planet 50] and the release of latest Joker movie made it a timely choice.	|
|	The Most Important Thing Illuminated	|	Howard Marks	|	EBOOK	|	I'm spiritually a value investor.	|
|	The Iceman Cometh	|	Eugene O'Neill	|	EBOOK	|	Great theatre; no further explanation needed. 	|
|	The Emperor of All Maladies	|	Siddhartha Mukherjee	|	AUDIOBOOK	|	[Time 100 Nonfiction]	|
|	Capitalist Realism	|	Mark Fisher	|	EBOOK	|	Can't remember how this author/title came to my attention. His breakdown of _Children of Men_ worth the price of admission alone. |
|	Algorithms to Live By	|	Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths	|	EBOOK	|	Brother put me onto an author interview. Thought the book might provide inspiration for further posts on the site.	|
|	DUNE	|	Frank Herbert	|	EBOOK	|	Been curious about this title for years. Even had it as a hold for 12+ months at library. Seeing that a new film version was scheduled for the following year was the final straw in my taking the dive. I was blown away. 	|
|	Pretending Is Lying	|	Dominique Goblet	|	EBOOK	|	Always on the lookout for a solid graphic novel. Her portrayal of her father and his temper. Her portrayal of her lover and the presence of his ex were brilliant.	|
|	Tragedy, the Greeks, and Us	|	Simon Critchley	|	EBOOK	|	Heard author interview and found his presentation engaging. The book was even better (e.g., Tragedy's philosophy v Philosophy's tragedy).	|
|	The Sandman (1989), Volume 1	|	Neil Gaiman	|	EBOOK	|	[Forbidden Planet 50]	|
|	A Streetcar Named Desire	|	Tennessee Williams	|	EBOOK	|	Great theatre; no further explanation needed. 	|

|	Prisoners of Geography	|	Tim Marshall	|	AUDIOBOOK	|	A sucker for geopolitical angles.	|
|	This Is Marketing	|	Seth Godin	|	AUDIOBOOK	|	Godin always provides cleary articulated insights. |
|	Pale Fire	|	Vladimir Nabokov	|	EBOOK	|	Well, it's Nabokov and [Time 100 Novels] |
