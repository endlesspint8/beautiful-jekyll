### Slow Down
### Themes Not Such a New Thing

## Other Projects

### Fear is the mind-killer

Books are intimidating. They should be intimidating. If you have not been intimidated recently by a text then you have not faced up to, literally brought within inches of your nose, greatness. In an age when we can carry personal libraries in our back pocket that would have been the envy of kings past there's no excuse. Better said, there are only excuses. Let's face up to that. It is part of life, part of being human. To bring it full circle, one of the best resources to help you face life, understand your own (human) being, are books.

Fear is also a gift. It is a signal of danger and we should be grateful for such warning signs. Though we are not talking about physical harm (unless you have Jason Bourne punching out your throught with a book spine in mind) there is still a danger with great books. The most obvious that I can think of is that you are found wanting. Not fully ready to understand a text you're left dejected, perhaps angry. Basically you've failed in some way and you are intimately aware of this. The other main candidate for fear is change. Change is uncomfortable and when extreme enough it can result in our ceasing to be who we (think we) are at the moment of fear. 

In this second, I would argue even more prevalent, form fear can be our guide to growth. We should face our fears in order to better understand them, to better understand ourselves. What is this fear driving at? What does that mean for me? The fear is a clue. 


### Read Accordingly 

> _"How's your mother?"_
>
> _"Ah, she's on her way out."_
>
> _"We all are, act accordingly."_

So says Jack Nicholson's character, Frank Costello, to a nobody sitting at the bar in _The Departed_. A seamingly superflous bit of banter whose short exchange belies what can be unpacked, both within the movie and when we step out of the theater. Our hour on the stage is all we have, all we know, and difficult to see beyond, as if we were blinded by the stage lights. The show will end. And though we know this we rarely know it with all of our being. Rather the knowledge of our inevitable demise is more often akin to being vaguely aware of an historical factoid. Interesting at times, amusing perhaps, but somehow inapplicable to daily life. 

Books are not life but they are one of the few things that I have found to make it richer. Reading is not the same thing as acting in the world but it is still one of the most rewarding activities available. I remain amused by my own death, regarding it more as theoretically true than the most incontrovertible fact of my existence. However, I am beginning to take it seriously enough to reconsider how I spend my life. A good part of that, of what remains, should be spent on reading only the things I find valuable and interesting. No excuses. 

There are undoubtedly more important things to address with what's left of one's time but I see no reason not to take the approach towards books as well. Exercising the culling of unnecessary objects, practices, and relationships from one's life while you still have the chance, the saying of "no", seems to me like a wonderful way to get a handle on what really counts, saying "yes".
