| _We_  | Yevgeny Zamyatin  | EBOOK  | Take that Orwell! Huxley, too?  |
| ~~_The Complete Short Novels_~~  | ~~Anton Chekhov (trans Larissa Volokhonsky)~~  | ~~EBOOK~~  | Apologies to the master but I ran out of time on the library loan due to too many tasks. However, I did read the first three of the five stories. Amazing, naturally. Intend to pick back up. Maybe next year we can do another Russian theme. |
| ~~_The Strange Order of Things_~~  |  ~~Antonio Damasio~~ |  ~~AUDIOBOOK~~ | Simply didn't grab me. Surprising given my interest in the intertwining of biology + society. |

| _Between Meals_  | A. J. Liebling  | EBOOK  |   |
| ~~_Aesthetic Intelligence_~~  |  ~~Pauline Brown~~ |  ~~EBOOK~~ | sandwiched bt two masterfully written titles dealing with Paris, and implicitly style/taste, it could not stand up  |
| _A Moveable Feast_  | Ernest Hemingway  | PRINT |   |
| _Saudi America_ | Bethany McLean  | AUDIOBOOK  | Heard author on podcast; short and sweet.  |
|	_The Broom of the System_	|	David Foster Wallace	|	PRINT	|	After his essay collections (Lobster & Fun Thing) I thought it about time to tackle one of his fiction works.	|
|	_The True History of Chocolate_	|	Sophie D. Coe	|	EBOOK	|	One of the [bitter](/tag/bitter) cousins. It was alright, a bit of a let-down in comparison to Uncommon Grounds (coffee).	|
|	_Touching a Nerve_	|	Patricia S. Churchland	|	AUDIOBOOK	|	Love me some consciousness exploration.	|
|	_Bayesian Analysis with Python (1st ed.)_ |	Osvaldo Martin	|	PRINTED	|	One of the six subject areas I'm particularly keen on at the moment. Also, found early perusals to show this as a strong text on fundimentals of the topic.	|
|	_Hellblazer (1988), Volume 1_	|	Jamie Delano	|	EBOOK	|	The Sandman (1989), Volume 1: wasn't familiar with J. Constantine when he popped up in the story + [Forbidden Planet 50]	|

|	_White Teeth_ | Zadie Smith | PRINT | [Time 100 Novels] |
|	_Batman: The Killing Joke_	|	Alan Moore	|	EBOOK	|	[Forbidden Planet 50] and the release of latest Joker movie made it a timely choice.	|

|	_The Iceman Cometh_	|	Eugene O'Neill	|	EBOOK	|	Great theatre; no further explanation needed. 	|
|	_The Emperor of All Maladies_	|	Siddhartha Mukherjee	|	AUDIOBOOK	|	[Time 100 Nonfiction]	|
|	_Capitalist Realism_	|	Mark Fisher	|	EBOOK	|	Can't remember how this author/title came to my attention. His breakdown of _Children of Men_ worth the price of admission alone. |
|	_Algorithms to Live By_	|	Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths	|	EBOOK	|	Brother put me onto an author interview. Thought the book might provide inspiration for further posts on the site.	|
|	_DUNE_	|	Frank Herbert	|	EBOOK	|	Been curious about this title for years. Even had it as a hold for 12+ months at library. Seeing that a new film version was scheduled for the following year was the final straw in my taking the dive. I was blown away. 	|
|	_Pretending Is Lying_	|	Dominique Goblet	|	EBOOK	|	Always on the lookout for a solid graphic novel. Her portrayal of her father and his temper. Her portrayal of her lover and the presence of his ex were brilliant.	|
|	_Tragedy, the Greeks, and Us_	|	Simon Critchley	|	EBOOK	|	Heard author interview and found his presentation engaging. The book was even better (e.g., Tragedy's philosophy v Philosophy's tragedy).	|
|	_The Sandman (1989), Volume 1_	|	Neil Gaiman	|	EBOOK	|	[Forbidden Planet 50]	|
|	_A Streetcar Named Desire_	|	Tennessee Williams	|	EBOOK	|	Great theatre; no further explanation needed. 	|

|	_Prisoners of Geography_	|	Tim Marshall	|	AUDIOBOOK	|	A sucker for geopolitical angles.	|
|	_This Is Marketing_	|	Seth Godin	|	AUDIOBOOK	|	Godin always provides cleary articulated insights. |
|	_Pale Fire_	|	Vladimir Nabokov	|	EBOOK	|	Well, it's Nabokov and [Time 100 Novels] |
