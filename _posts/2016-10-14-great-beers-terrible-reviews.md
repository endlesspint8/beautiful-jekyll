## "Yeah, well, that's just, like, your opinion, man." - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWdd6_ZxX8c" target="_blank">The Dude</a>

This post is inspired by BuzzFeed's 2015 "**_One-Star Amazon Reviews Of Classic Novels Are Hilarious_**" <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/margaretmaurer/one-star-amazon-reviews-of-classic-novels-18660?utm_term=.gnyqBma0vE#.psRMOdRGjr" target="_blank">article</a>. I could not help myself from tracking down some iconic and highly rated beers to see what an equivalent level of dissatisfaction would look like in my area of interest. A well regarded item with any longevity will inevitably have people taking shots at it. This may happen for a number of different reasons: dashed hopes, hype fatigue, schadenfreude, and sometimes simple misalignment of expectations. Additionally, unlike books in our modern world, certain beers are not universally available meaning on top of everything else people will take upon themselves travel, trade, and standing in line to get at some sought after suds. In the moment you have a less than satisfying beer in your gut it is difficult to keep in mind that the journey was as much the point as the destination. 

Below are ten top-shelf beers that overlap nicely between <a href="https://www.beeradvocate.com/lists/top/" target="_blank">BeerAdvocate</a> (BA) and <a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/top" target="_blank">RateBeer</a> (RB). Some of these beers have thousands of reviews, some of these beers have been around for decades and some of these beers have been touted at one time or another as the mythical "best beer in the world", yet they all failed a certain few that felt disappointed enough to express their resentment on the interwebs. 

As if anyone was listening. Well, I was.

I cannot stress enough that this beer is no better than another bourbon barrel aged stout on the shelf at your liquor store. I was really struggling to get any complexity's from it and there was no coffee flavor what so ever. Don't get me wrong this is a good beer but It's definitely is nothing special and I still can't believe what people will trade for this. Do yourself a favor and <a href="https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/287/37265/?ba=chinchillin85#review" target="_blank">mix expedition and double cream yourself</a> and add a little bourbon.

What’s my point? Humans are prone to mass delusion. The current wave in beer -- this "the more hops the better" kind of thinking that could lead thousands to claim Heady Topper as one of the world’s finest beers -- is just that. I really and truly do not believe that this beer actually tastes good to anyone. It is monolithic and plain gross - like drinking a can of pine-sol. May history be my witness: global warming is real and proclaiming to actually enjoy all these mega-hopped beers is nothing more than a fad -- one that’s been supercharged by dudes responding to some kind of intellectual insecurity. <a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/beer_name/32329/361441/" target="_blank">Heady Topper represents the apogee of the pendulum swing</a>, it is time to return to the timeless qualities of reason, balance, and refinement."
