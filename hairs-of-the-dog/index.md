> At least <a href="https://www.quora.com/Which-one-is-grammatically-correct-an-year-or-a-year" target="_blank">a(n) year</a> behind. By design.
>
> These near daily reflections are inconsistent in theme, tone, and focus; incoherent as to motivation; and in real life often times illegible. 
> 
> Even so, I have found them to be helpful, if for no other reason than to calm the mind and put things into perspective. The one thing I have _not_ done, which this space affords me the opportunity, is to go over these notes and identify recurring worries, challenges, and corrective measures.
>
> The hope is that by revisiting these pages I will better understand <a href="https://github.com/endlesspint8/endlesspint8.github.io/projects" target="_blank">how I work</a> and how I may work "better" moving forward. The time lag is a fortuitous element that should provide some distance between <a href="https://youtu.be/67E42LQsU24" target="_blank">myself and... myself</a>?
