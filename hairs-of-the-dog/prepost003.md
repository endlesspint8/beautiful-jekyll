**when do I** find the time to do (good) work? The "free" or down time at work is unpredictable & ultimately undesired. Weekends are a good - the best - time to spend w/the family & truly experience "what it's all about". Nights, mornings? Obviously I have to be a time thief, & a damn consistent one, if I expect to get things out on a regular basis, which is the goal. More foresight & continous effort, or really more of the same to date. _**keywords**: time; consistency; planning_

**my time is** precious regardless of how much I'll be able to set aside
for my interests. My concern here is with thinking deeply to become
most effective. If I imagined that the process would be "easy" or flow
what comes to mind are: predefined topics, schedule of writing,
getting data proactively, an iterative writing process, commitment to
delivery. Getting into the nitty gritty, breaking down the
essentials/objectives of each post is critical to my getting to work
immediately when I have the time and not wasting time figuring out
what to do next. Other elements of the process: time away to think and
be surprised by ideas, notetaking, regular indexing of ideas, regular
prioritization of tasks. _**keywords**: planning; process; time management_

**by the nature** of the work, by intention, by design, I will flounder
and struggle through. How do I focus and discipline myself to identify
and work on the required items to get the task done? Threats:
discouragement, frustration, distraction… I need to be ruthless in
identifying what needs to be done, find a holding in the assignment,
and progress a little each time. Yes! How do I create a small
win/success each time I work? The hours and effort are a foregone
conclusion - I need to have physical demonstrable progress to show for
each sitting. _**keywords**: progress; deliver; learn; defining success_

**deadlines: taxes & posting**. It's very likely the piece I
publish will be incomplete with respect to what I had envisioned. Not
different from what I was aiming for but actually incomplete. The
challenges that came up were too frequent… Excuses, but lessons
learned, as well. I could've course hold off, but that brings up the
question of what it is I'm trying to accomplish, and putting out the
best work is only part of actually putting out work. The piece runs, I
reassess, and I move On. There's a whole lot going on here and I
believe the best way to learn how to do it is to actually do it. _**keywords**: deliver; lessons learned; incomplete; schedule_
