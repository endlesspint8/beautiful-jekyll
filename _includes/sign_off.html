  <h3>Not too shabby, right?</h3>
  
  Agree or disagree, go ahead and drop me a <a href="mailto:endlesspint8@gmail.com?subject=Whattup from EP Reader">message</a>, <a href="{{ urltwitter }}" target="_blank">tweet</a> about it, and/or sign up for the <a href="http://bit.ly/ep8nlw" target="_blank">newsletter</a> to receive advance notice of posted content, added site features and opportunities to make suggestions for future data-related beer pieces and miscellany.
  
  If you're feeling <i>extra generous</i> go ahead and show your appreciation by <a href="https://www.paypal.me/EndlessPint/5">supporting this work</a> for the cost of a pint. These pieces take more effort than I care to admit and with the amount of sneaking around I'm doing at the office to get them out it is only a matter of time before the "supplimental" in supplimental income evaporates. 

  Drink well & stay curious, Reggie
