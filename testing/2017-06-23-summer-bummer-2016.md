## Whatchya got in that cup? Man, whatchya got in that cup?

Everyone likes a drink now and again. You can’t help it if others don't always appreciate the difficult week, new promotion, recent break up, or birthday celebration of the moment that has brought on a little imbibing. Apparently,  some people can be so bothered by this form of  expressiveness that they feel the need to have someone step in. That is where a "friendly" 311 call comes in. With summer officially starting today I looked to last year’s numbers to see what we have to deal with.

I was expecting far more calls and far more variety. For the entire summer of 2016 there were only 600+ calls (311 Social) across the five boroughs and they all fell into one of three complaint categories: after hours, public drinking, and under age. 

By far the most common, and something I touched on earlier [http://us14.campaign-archive2.com/?u=2bcb7588e60b55d3de7f33b21&id=a1c141200d], was public drinking. This makes intuitive sense. The other two categories are a bit more difficult to be aware of. Presumably any place attempting to stay open after hours is in a non/limited residential area. Any local bar that routinely tests their neighbors’ patience will be hard pressed to stay open long without complaints, followed by summons and possible closure with enough community pressure. As for the under age drinking, I am trying to imagine how these calls went down. Being outside of a venue you would have to have seen some young ass looking people going into a bar. Clubs often cater to 18-year-olds and up, so I am thinking the spots getting tattled on would be more of the bar/lounge types. The other main option that comes to mind is actually being in a place and spotting (again) young ass looking people, a.k.a. children, in the place. I suppose the discrepancy in appearance must be pretty egregious to make someone actually pick up the phone and make that call. What do you tell the operator? “Hey, there’re some children in the bar I am drinking at. Get them out of here. I don't like what it says about this place, myself, or the children themselves that we’re all drinking here." 

Perhaps, it's not so much the appearance of the suspected youngins as it is their behavior. We all know “da yutes” get a little carried away and sometimes drink a bit too hard, acting as if they’ve never been out before. Maybe in some instances that is the case. [Breakdown of location of complaints]

Public drinking calls accounted for more than two-thirds of all 311 calls. Instances of such drinking occurred in all boroughs, and every day of the week, at anytime of the day. Predictably, the public "happy hours" were around the weekend, from Friday through Sunday. This bump indicates in numbers indicates what we all could have guessed at, people cutting loose on a weekly basis from their school and/or work schedules. It really would have been interesting to have found out that no, in fact the busiest time to drink out doors was Tuesday morning. That would have suggested a problem of some other kind, either with the data or the drinking (of a bunch of people). 

With respect to public drinking there was more variety at the types people were taking advantage of that and the other two categories. Most of these I covered in the other piece [link] but a couple caught me off guard, one by its inclusion and a second by its exclusion. Granted it is probably a catchall designation but the location of park/playground caught me. I had actually forgotten/not considered that as an option. Yet in makes plenty of sense sitting back to my younger days
