## It was only a matter of time. 

London-based [IntelligentX Brewing Company](http://intelligentx.ai/) announced plans in 2016 to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to brew beer. Presumably better beer, but we will have to wait and see.[FN:And better how is an important qualification to keep in mind.] Starting with four base beer stlyes (Amber, Golden, Pale, and Black [stout?]), targeted consumer preference questions and Artificial Brewing Intelligence (ABI, read abbey, like the beer making monks; get it?) the company aims to leverage technology to more quickly and fully match beer batches with people’s tastes. Feedback questions are descriptive, explain what the terms used mean to better educate the drinkers and more accurately inform the algorithm, and can be done on a mobile (Facebook Messenger in one video). The combination of mobile, social, data, and craft beer is ingenious in that they each have overlapping and energetic demographics. The purported problem is to develop a beer for the customers in a faster more efficient and targeted manner. Through direct user input, at or near the time of consumption, the brewery will better be able to cater to customer preferences.

Data and, more broadly, research is absolutely a benefit to problems of all sorts, onsumer products included, especially one that directly targets our senses. Applying data and statistics to beer is no new thing, there is a legacy going back at least to the industrial revolution, the [Student's-T test at Guinness](https://priceonomics.com/the-guinness-brewer-who-revolutionized-statistics/), and the logistic and marketing efforts of the Big Boys. Getting customer input is a brilliant step to cutting down the feedback loop. Instead of running focus groups and scraping online reviews you have here a direct channel where you can ask targeted questions that immediately inform future development.

Craft beer is growing, data is proliferating, mobile is everywhere. The marriage of these things seems inevitable, by accidental market forces bumping into one another ([who invented the bicycle](https://www.livescience.com/44765-who-invented-the-bicycle.html) after all?) if not by intention. There is a, “it makes sense” kind of angle. The use of data can be a story in itself. Beer is always a fun thing to cover. It does not seem to take much, if you have a catchy idea, to get some coverage. That is all for the good. The more general coverage the more chance of intriguing casual beer drinks to something more interesting.

Runnnig headlong into a technological solution without a clear idea of the purpose is likely to get us where Thoreau warned, inventions that are but improved means to an unimproved end. Is the goal the best beer for a sole consumer, a demographic, the mystical average person or something for a company to hook us into buying? 

To better tackle this interesting issue we will leverage [Neil Postman's seven questions of technology](https://youtu.be/hlrv7DIHllE). 

## 1. What is the problem to which this technology is a solution?

Casting as wide and generous a net as possible while focusing on the beer drinking experience we can come up with several problems that this technology may address. The technology would provide a topic of conversation when one needed something to talk about. It might provide a sense of importance at being asked for input by the brewer. The process of drinking, thinking, and questionnaire clicking engenders product engagement. At a time when one has only a few thousand (million?) distractions at arm’s length there is space yet for another excuse to bring out our phones and break eye contact with the humans in our vicinity. 

The problems for the brewery are more concrete. There is the trouble of putting out several beers and not knowing which will take off, if any. Getting noticed in a busy field is always a concern. Allowing for immediate customer feedback provides a built in excuse for a less than stellar beer. The very blandness of a beer only reinforces the story of providing a blank canvas from which to build on together. This togetherness of brewery and drinker ties in nicely with the aforementioned customer engagement and follow-up curiosity that could lead to repeat purchases and/or word of mouth marketing. Additionally, any automated component has the potential for cost savings, whether by cutting back on labor, introducing efficiencies, or both. Whatever the upfront expenses for creating and running the algorithm they would be more than made up for by no longer needing to hire as many, as sophisticated, or as dedicated (fulltime v partime) brewers as before. 

The benefits of making customers think more critically about their beer aside, this approach to matching drinker preferences to potential beers only gets in the way of bringing these two together. Drinkers could just pick up another of the 1,000+ beers available in their region and seasonally rotated in, as opposed to waiting for the next algo-infused batch. The drinker will always be quicker at iterating the experience than any brewery, at least until we have matter compilers. This technology does not address a problem for the drinker, which leads us to ask… [FN: “Not solutions to any problem a normal person would regard as significant.” (Postman lecture)]

## 2. Whose problem is it?

Finding the right beer is an ongoing quest, something enjoyable in its own right. There are thousands of breweries with tens of thousands of beer options across 100+ beer styles. Each of these three inputs growing in number yearly, proof of the creativity and explorative nature of the craft beer community, drinker and brewer alike. With so many choices (information glut)  the drinker can get lost but, as with anything else, the circuitous nature of discovery is part of the learning process, something that will help develop a foundation for the subject. If a recommendation is desired one may be asked of the bartender, the store clerk, or friends. Each of these options raises the opportunity for a conversation that could lend additional insight and context than “people who enjoyed this beer also drank these.” [knowledge prefered to efficiency/decontextualized information] 

Drinkers might pick up some beer history, information on the brewing process, personal anecdotes, brewery stories, ideas about the establishment, as well as get a better handle on their friends’ preferences and tastes (or lack thereof). Conversation allows for give and take, the best form of engagement and feedback yet invented for our species. 

On the flip side to all the options is the problem of standing out, consistently and persistently. A quality product, with good distribution, and exposure are still some of the best ways of accomplishing this. Gimmicks work if backed by reliable characteristics but on their own are not built for sustained repeat purchases. The use of machine learning to create a better beer is a problem for the brewer not the consumer. To the extent that beer recommendations of a tech nature are desired drinkers may turn to online resources, apps, and forums for guidance.


## 3. Suppose we solve this problem, and solve it decisively, what new problems might be created because we have solved the problem?

The first thought, as with so many technologies nowadays, is job displacement. Whatever head brewer and supporting staff are needed can be reduced, perhaps even replaced. Short of removing the humans there remains the threat of deskilling, only retaining work that is a pastiche of tasks without any logic to their responsibility other than their being the things left over by the algorithm. This is not human logic but machine logic(link: Morpheus, sentinel for every man, woman, and child). 

In the rush and enthusiasm to automate processes we have unearthed a set of unexpected issues that are most generously described as ironic. Automation is implemented for a variety of reasons, many of them valid, some wishful: from quicker, more reliable, consistent, and predictable responses to removing human error, bias, and/or expenses. Crucially, things do go wrong. Depending on the importance of the process businesses/governments wish to keep a human in the loop as a safety precaution for the unexpected and unlikely. The irony par excellence is that “the more advanced a control system, the more crucial the human operator” (IOA). This would be humorous but for the accompanying problems.

Designers of automated processes unintentionally introduce two sources of new trouble. First, there are the designer errors themselves which are a “major source of operations problems” (IOA). Second, whatever is left out of the automation is left over for the human elements, to either monitor or takeover. Essentially, these left over responsibilities may be disparate tasks with no rhyme or reason, showing no consideration or respect for the work of the human.

Within the remaining responsibilities for human operators, monitoring and take over, we may review the cognitive and manual expertise needed. The major challenge in either case is a disassociation, distancing and deskilling of the operators; transforming a previously expert professional into a non-expert. 

In order for an operator to take effective and rapid control of a misbehaving process they must make a step change: one moment they are attentive to something else, they may or may not be the one monitoring the process, and the next they are in the position of taking control. Depending on how infrequently the operator is actually using their skills we can expect a deterioration in ability (deskilling). Ironically we have made the prospect of takeover a more complex issue than if an operator were manually in charge at all times. What is required at the time of takeover is someone with more expertise, not less, but the system fosters the latter.

In the instance of monitoring it has been shown that humans struggle to stay attentive to infrequently changing inputs for longer than 30 minutes at a time. The automated system requires supervision that a human is ill adept at providing. Besides issues of inattention and anomaly identification we face much the same trouble as with takeover. An operator’s knowledge is dependant on the frequency of use. It is in this repetition that the operator collects information about behavior, feedback, predictions and outcomes. An expert does not simply have raw data about a scenario in mind but rather an intricate web of results coming from predictions and decisions made (IOA). Any one moment is but a snapshot and taken on its own, without context, an artificial construction that is inadequate in describing the process that got us to the situation. 

[How will we empower intelligent disobedience if we are all just dial readers?!]

The removal of human expertise will mean a greater reliance on the tools and fewer in house brewery authorities who can tell how and why their beer works from a taste perspective or alternatively when a batch is off. You would have created a brewery without a brewer. Should things go wrong with the recipe, the preparation, the storage, or countless other things on the way to the customer the business would not have the in-house intelligence to target and address the problem. 

This lack of internal expertise radiates outward when you imagine the implementation of such technology to other firms. By displacing additional staff, perhaps holding on to the head brewer alone or some other qualified (enough) persons to serve as the human-in-the-loop the industry may ultimately undercut the number of next generation brewers, as well as the quality. 

We might be giving this one application of the technology undue significance but beyond one circumstance of the “AI” we could easily imagine, and are being more often the targeting of, new implementations of AI and high tech “solutions.” Naturally you can say that is part of the point. AI will replace brewers, cut down on positions, and we will need fewer staff per barrel. The fact that we have fewer would appear to be a market correction. However, beyond the reduction of people we are potentially removing our understanding of the process by undercutting the apprenticeship inherent in the job training. Implementing this technological solution could set back and potentially suspend our ability to create new and delicious beer for as long as we rely on it.
