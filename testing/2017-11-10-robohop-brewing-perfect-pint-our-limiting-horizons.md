## It was only a matter of time. 

London-based [IntelligentX Brewing Company](http://intelligentx.ai/) announced plans in 2016 to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to brew beer. Presumably better beer, but we will have to wait and see.[FN:And better how is an important qualification to keep in mind.] Starting with four base beer stlyes (Amber, Golden, Pale, and Black [stout?]), targeted consumer preference questions and Artificial Brewing Intelligence (ABI, read abbey, like the beer making monks; get it?) the company aims to leverage technology to more quickly and fully match beer batches with people’s tastes. Feedback questions are descriptive, explain what the terms used mean to better educate the drinkers and more accurately inform the algorithm, and can be done on a mobile (Facebook Messenger in one video). The combination of mobile, social, data, and craft beer is ingenious in that they each have overlapping and energetic demographics. The purported problem is to develop a beer for the customers in a faster more efficient and targeted manner. Through direct user input, at or near the time of consumption, the brewery will better be able to cater to customer preferences.

Data and, more broadly, research is absolutely a benefit to problems of all sorts, onsumer products included, especially one that directly targets our senses. Applying data and statistics to beer is no new thing, there is a legacy going back at least to the industrial revolution, the [Student's-T test at Guinness](https://priceonomics.com/the-guinness-brewer-who-revolutionized-statistics/), and the logistic and marketing efforts of the Big Boys. Getting customer input is a brilliant step to cutting down the feedback loop. Instead of running focus groups and scraping online reviews you have here a direct channel where you can ask targeted questions that immediately inform future development.

Craft beer is growing, data is proliferating, mobile is everywhere. The marriage of these things seems inevitable, by accidental market forces bumping into one another ([who invented the bicycle](https://www.livescience.com/44765-who-invented-the-bicycle.html) after all?) if not by intention. There is a, “it makes sense” kind of angle. The use of data can be a story in itself. Beer is always a fun thing to cover. It does not seem to take much, if you have a catchy idea, to get some coverage. That is all for the good. The more general coverage the more chance of intriguing casual beer drinks to something more interesting.

Runnnig headlong into a technological solution without a clear idea of the purpose is likely to get us where Thoreau warned, inventions that are but improved means to an unimproved end. Is the goal the best beer for a sole consumer, a demographic, the mystical average person or something for a company to hook us into buying? 

To better tackle this interesting issue we will leverage [Neil Postman's seven questions of technology](https://youtu.be/hlrv7DIHllE). 

## 1. What is the problem to which this technology is a solution?

Casting as wide and generous a net as possible while focusing on the beer drinking experience we can come up with several problems that this technology may address. The technology would provide a topic of conversation when one needed something to talk about. It might provide a sense of importance at being asked for input by the brewer. The process of drinking, thinking, and questionnaire clicking engenders product engagement. At a time when one has only a few thousand (million?) distractions at arm’s length there is space yet for another excuse to bring out our phones and break eye contact with the humans in our vicinity. 

The problems for the brewery are more concrete. There is the trouble of putting out several beers and not knowing which will take off, if any. Getting noticed in a busy field is always a concern. Allowing for immediate customer feedback provides a built in excuse for a less than stellar beer. The very blandness of a beer only reinforces the story of providing a blank canvas from which to build on together. This togetherness of brewery and drinker ties in nicely with the aforementioned customer engagement and follow-up curiosity that could lead to repeat purchases and/or word of mouth marketing. Additionally, any automated component has the potential for cost savings, whether by cutting back on labor, introducing efficiencies, or both. Whatever the upfront expenses for creating and running the algorithm they would be more than made up for by no longer needing to hire as many, as sophisticated, or as dedicated (fulltime v partime) brewers as before. 

The benefits of making customers think more critically about their beer aside, this approach to matching drinker preferences to potential beers only gets in the way of bringing these two together. Drinkers could just pick up another of the 1,000+ beers available in their region and seasonally rotated in, as opposed to waiting for the next algo-infused batch. The drinker will always be quicker at iterating the experience than any brewery, at least until we have matter compilers. This technology does not address a problem for the drinker, which leads us to ask… [FN: “Not solutions to any problem a normal person would regard as significant.” (Postman lecture)]
