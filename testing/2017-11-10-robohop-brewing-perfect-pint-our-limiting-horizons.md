## Intro

It was only a matter of time. London-based [IntelligentX Brewing Company](http://intelligentx.ai/) announced plans in 2016 to leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to brew beer. Presumably better beer, but we will have to wait and see.[FN:And better how is an important qualification to keep in mind.] Starting with four base beer stlyes (Amber, Golden, Pale, and Black [stout?]), targeted consumer preference questions and Artificial Brewing Intelligence (ABI, read abbey, like the beer making monks; get it?) the company aims to leverage technology to more quickly and fully match beer batches with peopleâ€™s tastes. Feedback questions are descriptive, explain what the terms used mean to better educate the drinkers and more accurately inform the algorithm, and can be done on a mobile (Facebook Messenger in one video). The combination of mobile, social, data, and craft beer is ingenious in that they each have overlapping and energetic demographics. The purported problem is to develop a beer for the customers in a faster more efficient and targeted manner. Through direct user input, at or near the time of consumption, the brewery will better be able to cater to customer preferences.

Data and, more broadly, research is absolutely a benefit to problems of all sorts, certainly when it comes to consumer products, especially one that directly targets our senses. Applying data and statistics to beer is no new thing, there is a legacy going back at least to the industrial revolution, the [Student's-T test at Guinness](https://priceonomics.com/the-guinness-brewer-who-revolutionized-statistics/), and the logistic and marketing efforts of the Big Boys. Getting customer input is a brilliant step to cutting down the feedback loop. Instead of running focus groups and scraping online reviews you have here a direct channel where you can ask targeted questions that immediately inform future development.
