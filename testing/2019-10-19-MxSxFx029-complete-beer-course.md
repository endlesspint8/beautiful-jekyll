As exciting a time as it is to be a beer drinker today, it is also one of the most confusing times. The number of breweries and variety of styles available can easily overwhelmed the casual drinker, let alone a neophyte. It would be a shame to allow all of those good to great flavors pass you by simply due to a little confusion and a touch of intimidation. Titles such as _The Complete Beer Course_ (Joshua M. Bernstein) help remove a good amount of the unknown and help build confidence around what is an endlessly approachable and delicious beverage. As with a single beer itself, this book can be assessed on its appearance, swirl and smell, and its taste.


Twelve lessons across a variety of subject matters, primarily beer styles, but also the fundamentals of taste, pairing and cellaring, truly make this a crash course in coming up to speed on a ton of material. The material is also immediately tied to the present by way of two methods: an end of chapter brewery spotlight and intra chapter beer style representatives for the reader to go out and find to appreciate the numerous styles and sub styles of beer available. These two characteristics, primarily the latter help ground the large amount of information into a concentrated point. As the author reminds us, “we have to practice tasting and preference is a matter of perspective.” The best way of uncovering what we enjoy is by getting out there and gaining some experience. His intuition to hands on participation extends to storing beer as well as food pairing, two of the more advanced, challenging, and enjoyable aspects of appreciating one’s beer to the utmost.

##Appearance

[Perhaps begin with physical appearance, i.e., dimension, weight, gloss] Twelve logically laid out chapters. First, everyone is brought up to speed on beer making and tasting. A common vocabulary is presented so that the remainder of the book is coherent and makes sense to the reader. Plenty of photos and sidebars to keep the presentation fresh and break up the amount of material. A scan and zoom approach (not quite fractal): find a style, go to chapter, browse through, find sub style descriptions, present day examples, go to the store and sample in real life. A good setup that we can work with.


## Swirl & Smell

[take some of previous section and move here] Historical tidbits, brewery profiles, a run down on ingredients and processes. The author writes with passion, knowledge, and clarity. This title definitely passes the smell test…


## Taste

Part of what you are looking for in a book of this sort is its effectiveness as a reference guide. Perhaps this is what most people look for, even after reading it front to back. And I case this title may be added to a handful of others that are candidates for this role in your own library. There’s no saying you cannot have more than one reference book. In fact, I recommend a few of the classics to have by your side: _Tasting Beer_ and Oliver’s _The Brewmaster’s Table_ to name just two. This title fits among and between the two classics, digging a bit deeper on some topics than the first without being as exhaustive on the food aspect, naturally, as the latter.

A well thought out and structured approach to tackling the seemingly endless beer styles out there. The chapters have a consistent framework while avoiding becoming formulaic. There is enough variety sprinkled into the predictable patterns of the chapters to avoid their becoming repetitive. This continued freshness is no easy task for a subject so large, at least it is no easy temptation to sidestep. The opening two chapters are the longest and a true crash course in getting readers on equal footing with respect to beer ingredients, production, and serving presentation. With this backbone in place the book commences to branch out, running through various beer styles and categories.


Similar to a flight or multi-course meal we begin with lighter fare, progressing toward richer, more flavorful offerings, going from the clean, crisp lagers and pilsners of central Europe and North America to the pales of England and Belgium, the hop bombs that have become ubiquitous and onwards to Belgian darks, porters, stouts  and barley wines.


The book’s “building up” chapters are well laid out and organized. Beer style chapters provide a personal touch from the author, historical tidbits, cultural trivia, two or more recommended styles for some at-home, real world follow up, finishing off with a brewery spotlight.


The information is well put together and laid out. However, there is a ton of information for a newbie and it is not quite clear they would not be overwhelmed by it, end up putting the book down from overload, and leaving it laying around as a coffee table – also not a bad option as there are several dozen illustrations worth leafing through. The book is naturally a quick reference guide for when a fact or historical angle needs confirmation. If the reader is not overwhelmed by the endless beers, and why would they (blasphemy!). The writing style is casual and engaging, broken up into tiny bits that can be experienced at an individually convenient pace. Additionally, this book clocks in at just 300 pages so the journey is not endless, though some of the larger chapters can at times seem long (e.g. the ground laying chapters 1 and 2). It is inevitable that with so much technical, historical, and tasting information on hand the reader will come across something new (e.g. Belgian 8 = 1.080 OG) or a variation on how to look upon a familiar topic.


Taking the book in context with others one can see quite clearly that it fits its own niche well…


The subtitle does contain the word “Boot Camp“ an appropriate description for the depth, breath and speed in which the topics are covered. Much of the essence for individual stories are relayed without welding too long at any one story or thread. At the same time, the delivery is quick but somehow avoid being a mind numbing rat-a-tat barrage. This goes back to relying on a basic framework without being entirely beholden to it. Within the flexibility enters space to breathe and take in the lessons. As with Russian dolls the structure allows for clear mind map of the layout and where to place things, find them later on when the reader may need them. Each chapter/class has its own specific style or topic, within each chapter/class we have a personal author’s note for onboarding us to the subject. After a little history and some flavor descriptions we get to specific styles, with contemporary examples to go find for ourselves. Sprinkled throughout are trivia as well as special festivals, breweries, ingredients to highlight. Lastly, chapters usually end with a brewery spotlight.
