## Round Features v. Judges' Cards

Having looked at how Twitter folk saw the fight we now turn our attention to the ringside judges' take. Additionally, we will take a look at the fight numbers to get a better idea of _what_ people were seeing.

I thought it was a bit fishy that Ward won five rounds straight and unanimously from the beginning of the second half of the bout. Then we see the numbers and it is clear that precision was very high for those rounds. This analysis looks at raw numbers as punch outputs only differentiated by jab or power punch. We have not looked at nor is there as yet an adequate way of measuring "pain" [link: Clubber Lang]. Having said as much, you can imagine that being given the impression that when one fighter throws and he's consistently connecting (+40%) he is in control.

A second pass confirms what most of our eyes saw while adding a bit of nuiance (perhaps).
