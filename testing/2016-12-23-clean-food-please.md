Much is asked of New Yorkers, from high rent, congestion, overstuffed subway cars, and extreme weather conditions, to crowded tourist traps, inconsiderate assess who stand in front of subway doors, and dealing with being attached to a country that is determined to repeatedly vote against its own interests. For this it is fair that we ask and receive some things in return. 

We ask these things as citizens, family members, customers and as members of various groups. When forking over that hard earned cash that's made just a bit more discretionary by subjecting ourselves to living with perfect strangers it is right and fair that we receive in turn something of value and quality. Perhaps a steal is too much to ask for but a fair deal nonetheless. 

Prices continue to rise everywhere, the beer scene being no exception. So what are we getting for those ducketts? There’s the marked up pint. What else? 

My  top  priority  in  a  beer  bar  is  naturally  the  beer  but  that's  not  all  that  goes  into  my  preferring  one  place  to  another.  Many ingredients  get tossed into that meat grinder of judgement. Depending how well the various aspects of any one bar mesh  determines  the  final  reaction.  Among  complementary  aspects  that make  beer  taste  even  better  are  location,  clientele,  kitchen,  television  (the  fewer  the  better),  and   acoustics,  by  which  I  mean  both  ambient  noise  level  and/or  background  music,  if  any.

Again, what are we getting in return for those thrice taxed dollars? General ambience,  heating during the cold months,  some television (say it with me, “the fewer the better”),  perhaps pretzels, and  water.<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> A convivial bartender. Now we're talking, now we're getting somewhere. And what do you have for food? I see a nice spread on the menu but can it be trusted? 

If  you’re  going  to  spend  time  and  money  drinking and  eating  at  a place  you want some reassurance as to the quality of the products.  Caveat  emptor  and  all  that  carpe.

One  of  the  most  natural  things  to  offer  alongside  craft  beer  is  food.  On  an Epicurean  level  beer pairs  well  with  about  any dish out  there  (link:  brewmaster's  table) and there are few things more adept at creating a convivial atmosphere than drinking and eating. 

Going  to  a  bar  should  be  a  happy  occasion.  The  more  things  you  have  to  look  forward  to  when  you  head  out  the  better your  chances  of  enjoying  yourself.  There's  the  camaraderie of a close group of  friends,  the  prospects  of  attracting  new  people,  catching  up  with  old  acquaintances,  and  of  course  enjoying  your  libations.  I  prefer  my  beer,  as  you  well  know,  but  whatever  it  is  you  drink  make  sure  it's  something  you  enjoy.<sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup>   

Another  feature  to look forward  to  when  heading  out,  and  increasingly  so,  is  the  grub.  The  food  offered  at  craft bars  is  becoming ever more spectacular  and  would  be  unrecognizable  as  pub fare  if  it  weren't  for  the  dozen  or  so  taps on the wall.  It's  not  just  Buffalo wings  and  onion rings that  can  be  appreciated alongside a pint nowadays.  

I am   very  often  swayed  by  which  bar to  go  to  based  on  the  kitchen.  Listen,  a  good  bar   rotation  will  pull  me  in  with  it's  siren  song  but  I'll  make  sure  to  work  in  that  other  bar’s  kitchen/menu  as  needed,  whether  it's  where  I  start  or  end  up.  Naturally  with  food  preparation  of  any  kind  you  want  to  have  some  reassurances  about  the  quality  of  what  ends  up  on  your  plate  and  that's  a  story  that  begins  long before  the  dish  is  put  in  front  of  you,  just  as  it  does  for  your  pint.  

We  will not  be  going  as  far  back  as  the  farm  in  this  piece  but  we  will  take  it  back  a  couple  of  steps  to  the  kitchen  itself  to  see  what  it  is  we're  up  against  when  we  pony  up  to  the  bar  of  our  choice  for  a  pint  and  a  bite. I'll  be  focusing  specifically  on the  criteria of  cleanliness  and  hygiene.  This  is  not a  shame  piece  so  I  will not be  calling  out  particular  bars  but  the  reader  has the ability to  judge  for  themselves.

Like  any  self-respecting  city  of  the  20th  century  New  York  City  does  health  inspections  of,  among  other  things,  restaurants.  Like  any  self-respecting  21st  century  city  NYC makes  this  data  <a href="https://nycopendata.socrata.com/" target="_blank">openly  available</a>.  Inspections  are  unannounced  yearly  occurrences  where  an  establishment  receives  a  certain  number  of  points  for  each  violation,  critical  or  otherwise.  The  points  are  tallied  up  per inspection  and a final grade (A, B, C) is  based  on  the  resulting  score, the fewer points  the  better.

Taking  the  top  30  craft  beer  bars  of  Manhattan  as  identified  on FourSquare  I  set about  gathering  their  respective  scores,  code  violations,  and  grades.  I  did  the  same  for  all  other  inspected  establishments  in  Manhattan,  bar  or  otherwise. 


The  craft  beer  bar  inspection  average  of  12.89 just  qualifies  for  an average grade of A.  The  same  average  for  all  other  non-craft  beer  bars  is  14.68.  This  difference  of  1.79  pushes  the  other  establishments  over  the  points threshold  into  a  Grade  B  average.

On  top  of  this  being a 10%  difference  it  is  a  statistically  significant  one as well.  This  was  established  via  a  ho-hum t-test  and  by  running  a shuffling  and sampling of  the  two  populations.  Not  only  are  you  much more  likely  to  find  better  beer  at  these  establishments  than at  a  random  place  but  you're  also  more  likely  to  find  a  cleaner  kitchen.  I  am  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdXO52ZMcCM" target="_blank">Jack's  clear  conscience</a>.

Below is a timeline of the 30 craft beer bars considered. Each horizontal line and their attending dots represent one establishment. The occurrence of the dots appear at specific times (x-axis), may be multiple for an inspection, and are colored as to their severity (red for critical, yellow for not critical, and gray for not applicable). The lines themselves stretch from the earliest inspection date recorded to the most recent. In the couple of instances of there being only one inspection to date no line is present.

The lines serve several purposes. First, they make the reading and grouping of the dots per establishment more clear. Second, they provide a convenient means of comparing length of inspection ranges between bars. Lastly, the lines themselves are color coded to convey information as to the grade carried by a bar. These colors match the NYC grade color scheme where meaningful. Thus the grades A, B, & C are rendered as blue, green, and orange, respectively. Inspection dates need not always result in a new or retained grade. I use white to indicate when there is no grade given out for a specific inspection date. This color will be extended until the next grade. As best as I can ascertain grades are retained unless specifically changed, even so I prefer this color scheme to at least differentiate the awarding/retaining upgrades. The color gray is also used, though difficult to see, for grades of “P”, passing. One particular feature of the open data not visualized are the violation points incurred per inspection.<sup id="a3">[3](#f3)</sup> 

Was I relieved by the findings? Certainly with respect to my past stomach exposure. I also wish the craft bars under inspection well if for no other reason than to allow for their continued serving of my main reason for frequenting them, the pouring of delicious pints. Alternatively, I would hope that for the hefty price stuck on these beers we would be provided with some perks. A clean kitchen is definitely a good start.

I leave for another time the analysis of the cuisine itself. A quick look around made me  reconsider expanding the scope of this piece. Perhaps if Zagat had some quick numbers to glean insight from, but in many instances that fine New York establishment does not even offer food ratings [link] on these locales. So be it. Having now established some small appreciation for the quality of the preparation and handling of the food it would be a natural extension to see about the quality of the chow itself. Stay tuned or, if you're reading this sufficiently far into the future, follow the link to that next piece I intend to place below.

<b id="f3">3</b> The inclusion of linewidth variation to portray violation scores proved, for the time being anyway, a bit too much to include. I submit a small version of the image here and move on.
