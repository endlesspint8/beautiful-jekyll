## NOT WRONG TO FOCUS ON MANHATTAN


THE PEOPLE ARE THERE: Even if you don’t live in Manhattan you’re very likely to work there (http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/03/commuters-nearly-double-manhattans-daytime-population-census-says/?_r=0). The borough population doubles every workday (1.6 to 3.1 million). Besides MH only trendy bubble Brooklyn has more than half its workers living in the same borough.

## WHAT DO THE RESPECTIVE STORES CARRY? TAPS? GROWLERS?

Craft beer is here, hooray. There are more breweries and styles than ever before. Taste has won over mass produced piss and we may all rest easy now. Not so fast. While we may be experiencing a Golden Age in beer consumer opportunity there is no guarantee these days are here to last. With more options come more challenges, opportunities, and developments. 


Challenges: more breweries, more competition, more difficult to be noticed in the market. Opportunities: breweries are supplementing their revenue with at the brewery on-premise sales which offer a giant boost to their bottom line, but may result in more competition for your favorite local pub. Developments: there are acquisitions and partnerships happening all around us that are primed to change the market over the coming years as more money comes in – keg pricing, distribution, franchised brewpubs. 


Another one of these "challenge opportunity developments” is the rise in take-home (off premise) purchases of beer. With the seasons changing and dollars getting tight with the holidays approaching it seems like a good time to look at the options for New York City residents. Just because it's cold outside doesn't mean you can't have your own little slice of craft beer heaven at home. And for less of a markup than at a bar. 


Setting aside your local bodega, which I absolutely suggest you support first, second, and last I went about identifying where to go should you only have two options, Whole Foods and Trader Joe's, based on your spatial positioning. Now no matter where you find yourself in the city you can choose the store closest to you based on the map provided here.


In keeping with the holiday spirit, and coincidentally the branding colors themselves, I've colored the store dots and respective Voronoi sections either red or green. My apologies to the color blind audience out there but I have not forgotten about you and you can use the following link to view the same data (http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/colorblind/). 


We see a few things straight away. Whole Foods has more stores and covers more territory across Manhattan than does Trader Joe’s. Whole foods also stretches further uptown and downtown that does Trader Joe's. while Trader Joe's position appears to have handed over much of the area they also appear to have an outsized while Trader Joe's position appears to have handed over much of the area they also appear to have an outsized area for their numbers. This can only happen by placing in stores teaching spaces in between the Whole Foods currently built. This is especially the case in the downtown area on the Eastside. Additionally, while the whole foods territory is quite expensive in at least two instances the positioning of the competitors doors are so close to deciding between one or another based on location is a tossup, further strengthening Trader Joe's positioning in relation to what the map would have you believe from only taking a quick glance.

HENCE, WHAT IS CLOSEST?
