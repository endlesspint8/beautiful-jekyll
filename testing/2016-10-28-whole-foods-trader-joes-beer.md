Craft beer is here, hooray. There are more breweries and styles than ever before. Taste has won over mass produced piss and we may all rest easy now. Not so fast. While we may be experiencing a Golden Age in beer consumer opportunity there is no guarantee these days are here to last. With more options come more challenges, opportunities, and developments. 

Challenges: more breweries, more competition, more difficult to be noticed in the market. Opportunities: breweries are supplementing their revenue with at the brewery on-premise sales which offer a giant boost to their bottom line, but may result in more competition for your favorite local pub. Developments: there are acquisitions and partnerships happening all around us that are primed to change the market over the coming years as more money comes in – keg pricing, distribution, franchised brewpubs. 

Another one of these "challenge opportunity developments” is the rise in take-home (off premise) purchases of beer. With the seasons changing and dollars getting tight with the holidays approaching it seems like a good time to look at the options for New York City residents. Just because it's cold outside doesn't mean you can't have your own little slice of craft beer heaven at home. And for less of a markup than at a bar. 

Who needs the artificially dark enclosures of a bar? Not in this season. The light runs out earlier every day. In a week or two the clocks themselves will stumble back an hour. This may reset the dark and dons but that light has to come from somewhere and it's from your afternoons. Soon enough the best bit of daytime light will come on your lunch hour. After you head back to work and come back out again to head home the entire city will have been enveloped in a cold dark blanket, as it would been sunk to the bottom of the Hudson river itself.

The little glimmers of light all about you come from the windows and streetlights. Head home where you can push back this dark enclosing with all manners of artificial lights: kitchen light, television, living room lamp, open the refrigerator. And in the refrigerator make sure to have something worth warming your belly and your spirit. You better have something good to eat and drink because you don't want to head back out into the cold darkness of a city. At least food gets delivered routinely and reliably, the same cannot be said for good beer. So on your way home step into a trusted store and grab yourself a six, a bomber, or a mix of sorts.


Stopping over can also serve as the light and warmth oasis between your office at home, or sightseeing and the hotel. Now with the favorite pint in hand you can turn on more light from your mobile or laptop. Still fighting back the outside coldness. While in here there will be warm and comradery.  


Setting aside your local bodega, which I absolutely suggest you support first, second, and last I went about identifying where to go should you only have two options, Whole Foods and Trader Joe's, based on your spatial positioning. Now no matter where you find yourself in the city you can choose the store closest to you based on the map provided here.

In keeping with the holiday spirit, and coincidentally the branding colors themselves, I've colored the store dots and respective Voronoi sections either red or green. My apologies to the color blind audience out there but I have not forgotten about you and you can use the following link to view the same data (http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/colorblind/). 

## NOT WRONG TO FOCUS ON MANHATTAN

We are going to restrict our analysis to one borough, Manhattan. This is for what will become obvious, if it is not already. Apropos of nothing, even with Brooklyn in Ascension on the cool and global consciousness for a decade, two decades, plus – forever if you talk to native born Brooklynites, and who can argue with a place that gave us Walt Whitman, when you think of New York you think of Manhattan. That aside, Manhattan sports a giant influx of people weather from commuters or tourists. Outside of the airports, which are always on the outskirts of cities anyway, many of the major transit clubs and terminals are in "the city". going back to the first non relevant point, let's be serious, when people say "the city" they mean the five boroughs generally but if you had to pick one spot it to be my head.

THE PEOPLE ARE THERE: Even if you don’t live in Manhattan you’re very likely to work there (http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/03/commuters-nearly-double-manhattans-daytime-population-census-says/?_r=0). The borough population doubles every workday (1.6 to 3.1 million). Besides MH only trendy bubble Brooklyn has more than half its workers living in the same borough.

The population of the island doubles on working weekdays taking in commuters and tourists from nearby and around the world. Only Brooklyn, which we can't seem to shake, matches Manhattan as a borough that has half or more of its residents working in the same borough.

## ALSO, THAT IS WHERE THE STORES ARE:

The other main reason to focus on Manhattan, is because that is where most of the stores are located and it makes for a more interesting piece to isolate our attention. The fact that there is a lone

We see a few things straight away. Whole Foods has more stores and covers more territory across Manhattan than does Trader Joe’s. Whole foods also stretches further uptown and downtown that does Trader Joe's. while Trader Joe's position appears to have handed over much of the area they also appear to have an outsized while Trader Joe's position appears to have handed over much of the area they also appear to have an outsized area for their numbers. This can only happen by placing in stores teaching spaces in between the Whole Foods currently built. This is especially the case in the downtown area on the Eastside. Additionally, while the whole foods territory is quite expensive in at least two instances the positioning of the competitors doors are so close to deciding between one or another based on location is a tossup, further strengthening Trader Joe's positioning in relation to what the map would have you believe from only taking a quick glance.
