_The voodoo priest and all his powders were as nothing compared to espresso, cappuccino, and mocha, which are stronger than all the religions of the world combined, and perhaps stronger than the human soul itself. —Mark Helprin, Memoir from Antproof Case (1995)_

_O Coffee! Thou dost dispel all care, thou are the object of desire to the scholar. This is the beverage of the friends of God. —“ In Praise of Coffee,” Arabic poem (1511)_

_“It is disgusting to notice the increase in the quantity of coffee used by my subjects, and the like amount of money that goes out of the country in consequence. My people must drink beer. His Majesty was brought up on beer, and so were his ancestors.”_
