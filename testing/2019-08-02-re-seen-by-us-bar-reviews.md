The Internet never forgets but perhaps it would be best if we partook of selective memory from time to time. When it comes to reviewing services in particular it would do us well to refresh our appraisals. While discounting the past may lend the most recent impressions an overvalued status, there is an intuitive appeal in listening more attentively to what people who have just had an experience have to say about it. Times, places and tastes change. We need not keep in stone the ratings of several years ago when we have more recent inputs to consider. Studio 54 of recent times is not the Studio 54 of yore; it would be absurd to expect the orgies of yesteryear when going today. On a less dramatic note we can consider this intuition when it comes to beer bars. 

Over the past decade-plus craft beer has stepped out of a niche interest into a conversation topic of general interest, even among those that cannot distinguish a Pilsner from a pale ale. In that time bars, breweries, selections, and knowledgeable consumers have proliferated. What was once considered a hop bomb now appears quaint; that 30-bottle selection, rotated seasonally, was a unicorn a couple of decades ago; and the Pilsner swigger has learned about a variety of beers. All of which is to say, perhaps it is time to consider discounting historical reviews so as to get closer to the pulse of the zeitgeist. A gradual removal of past reviews accomplishes two things, it captures a rating more in line with contemporary appraisals (quality) and it identifies the number of reviews within a selected time window (quantity).

Footnote: Another take on bar reviews allows us the opportunity to try a different data source. This in itself is not critical to the effort it does add a bit of melting, a slight twist to the effort to keep it even more interesting. 


With time being one of the primary factors in this exploratory review I wished to limit my choice of bars, both by quantity and to those that had the longest track record. This option was that the longest available time frames would provide the greatest opportunity to see rating changes. This assumption could also prove unfruitful as long-standing establishments might be the ones with the most consistent reviews, both in numbers and general ratings.

Three features to track: review counts, review scores, and time. The final element introduces flow, movement. Numbers carry about them a certain finality and certitude that does not always warrant the authority we bestow upon them. Be skeptical of precise numbers. Look for ranges, confidence intervals and other bits of wiggle that help provide a more complete picture of the situation. Speaking of pictures, charts can be of great help when there is not much to differentiate between summary statistics (e.g. Abscombe’s quartet).

Here is another toy example of breaking down numbers to see what else we can come up with, another angle to view things from and remind ourselves that the answers we get many times depend on the questions we ask. Those questions in turn are inspired by our interests. Footnote: This is not a case for relativism but rather underscoring the bootstrapping nature of many metrics and views we take for granted, grounded in the beings we are.
Selecting the top 30 beer bars in NYC as per TripAdvisor we can take a look at the ratings for each overtime. By grouping ratings to the months they were submitted we can easily provide weights to readings by month, with decreasing significance to those occurring earlier on, eventually dropping them altogether from consideration. To get us started reset the window of interest at 24 months. This was a judgment call that seemeds fitting for allowing past input without overdoing either what came before norther most recent impressions. Setting aside for specific numbers, we get what we expected: squiggly lines that help give an idea of patron preferences over time, general trends, and rates of change. There are also gaps in the ratings, sometimes of a couple of years, so we see the rating lines breaking off on the charts. This raised a subsequent thought regarding how long to retain readings in the absence of online customer engagement. Here too we resorted to a judgment call of a cut off of six months. Bars that had gone six or more months without a reading had their scores postponed. These gaps help to send a message to the potential patron about traffic, interest, and or whether the platform is sufficiently/adequate for the review of beer bars generally and the affected bars specifically.

Thus at minimum we are left with three ways of viewing bar appraisals: a simple rating average;  a time-discounted rating, with accompanying times series to visualize to changes; and the latter with the added wrinkle of suspending ratings in the absence of engagement. The question of which of these is the most informative relies on what one is looking for. Keeping in mind that all models are wrong but some are useful.






Salvage something for the conclusion:
Process and becoming; different vehicles, the same narrative – hero of 1000 faces: go to the wild, learn, come back, venture, close – assorted media: fairy tales, movies, video games, all coming to a conclusive end; no such thing until the end; always moving, always changing, ever influx; snapshots are informative as well as misinformative, dangerous to chase an image – a frozen representation of desire, which itself constantly changes; chasing shadows, of course never fulfilled when grasped, grasping at air; life is not fixicity and stasis can only mean death; even prominent goods are not guaranteed to meet expectations, as both production methods and tastes change

There is a whole lot going on there, we will tackle just a few of them and only superficially at that. What is to be hinted at: flow, process, becoming. [THEME]
