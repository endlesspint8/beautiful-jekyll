## Causal Shmausal

The [Great American Beer Festival](https://www.greatamericanbeerfestival.com/) (GABF) is the premier beer festival and awards competition in the United States, possibly the world. Breweries and brewers display their wins proudly and for good reason, especially with the explosion in number of breweries, entrants, and the subsequent competition in recent years. The GABF is no fringe occasion as it may have been from 1983-86, when just three places were awarded in a sole category, compared to the 288 award winners across 90+ categories in 2016.<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> <b id="f1">1</b> As with sports we can look back and divide the GABF past into the formative years and the modern era. The GABF 1987-present fits into the latter label by dint of multiple categories, award winners, and a constantly growing and more professional field. [↩](#a1) <br> Despite the steady growth of craft beer by volume, revenue, establishments and new adherents if search engagement is any indication the medals remain a niche interest. That is one of several hypotheses worth floating to help explain the low-to-non-to-occasionally-negative impact in [Google Trend](https://www.google.com/trends/?hl=en) searches for last year’s award winners, the month following the festival.
