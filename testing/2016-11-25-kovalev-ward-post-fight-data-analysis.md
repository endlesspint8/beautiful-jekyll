Nice build up, top quality fighters, one hell of a tactical and willful bout, and a controversial decision. That's boxing, baby!

I have my impressions on who won and am apparently curious enough about the result to want to dig deeper in order to get a more rounded take.

This three part (more or less) piece will explore the fight from several different angles. 

First we'll see what social media thought was happening in the moment.

Afterwards we will take a closer look at the round features and judge scores. How do they line up?

Lastly, unless more gets added, will be a review of the respective fighter's ELO ratings coming into the fight. 

## What do the Masses Have to Say?

I pulled the fight night tweets associated with the two primary hashtags, #KovalevWard and #WardKovalev, focused in on the bout itself, and identified the round and rest period time ranges.
