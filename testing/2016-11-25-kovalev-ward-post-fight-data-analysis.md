## Still too Close to Call

Nice build up, two top quality fighters, one hell of a tactical and willful bout, one knockdown and a controversial decision. That's boxing, baby!

I have my impressions on who won between Kovalev/Ward I (let's all hope there's a sequel in the near future) and am apparently curious enough about the result to want to dig deeper in order to get a more complete take.

This three part (more or less) piece will explore the fight from several different angles. 

First we'll see what social media thought was happening in the moment. Then we will take a closer look at the round features and judges' score cards (how do they line up?). Finally, will be a review of the respective fighter's ELO ratings coming into and exiting the fight. 

## What do the Masses Have to Say?

I pulled the fight night tweets associated with the two primary hashtags, #KovalevWard and #WardKovalev, focused in on the bout itself, and identified the round and rest period time ranges.

The purpose of narrowing in on the rounds and breaks was two-fold, to make the above graph and to only use the scores in the moment. I wanted to get the "as it happened" impression from fight fans. I was not interested in Monday morning quarterbacks or rationalizations of any sort. 

What I found was a whole lot of handwringing and excited viewers. Many rounds went unscored on an individual level, most times people simply commentating on how close and tense the fight was. The scores varied with wide margins on both sides but overall the ultimate proportions fall inline with most people's expectations, though there were some surprises from my perspective. 

Below are the percentages associated with how people saw the fight on a round-by-round basis. The darker the red the more Kovalev was favored. Meanwhile, the darker the blue the more impressed Twitter'ers (I guess that's one way of spelling it) were with Ward.

What we see is the story of two fights. Early Kovalev domination, including the knockdown in round 2,<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> followed by a steady  [FN: Amazingly I didn't find any knuckleheads who scored the round even or in favor of Ward. It's the internet, you never know.]
